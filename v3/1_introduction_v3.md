# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Context and Background

Social determinants of health (SDOH) encompass the environmental, societal, and economic factors that shape health trajectories throughout the lifespan (World Health Organization, 2023). These non-medical influences affect health outcomes through multiple mechanisms, including differential exposure to health risks, variable access to services, and uneven distribution of resources (Marmot, 2005). Key SDOH dimensions include economic stability, education, neighborhood environment, healthcare access, and social support systems (McNeill et al., 2023). Research indicates these factors collectively influence 60-80% of health outcomes—significantly more than medical interventions alone (Chen et al., 2020).

### 1.1.1 Conceptual Frameworks for SDOH

Several frameworks conceptualize social determinants of health, guiding variable selection and interpretation in SDOH-enhanced prediction systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) framework distinguishes between structural determinants (socioeconomic context) and intermediary determinants (material circumstances, psychosocial factors, behaviors). This hierarchical model acknowledges causal pathways through which social conditions influence health outcomes (World Health Organization Commission on Social Determinants of Health, 2008). The U.S. Healthy People 2030 initiative organizes social determinants into five domains: Economic Stability, Education Access, Healthcare Access, Neighborhood Environment, and Social Context. This structured approach aligns with U.S. health policy priorities, facilitating clinical implementation (Hacker et al., 2021). The Institute of Medicine classification emphasizes interrelationships between determinants across ecological levels, distinguishing upstream factors (social, economic conditions), midstream factors (behaviors, psychosocial factors), and downstream factors (physiological pathways). Its focus on causal pathways helps target specific mechanisms (Matheny et al., 2019). The optimal framework selection depends on application context. Chen et al. (2020) found Healthy People 2030 domains provided practical structure for organizing SDOH data within electronic health records, while the WHO framework offered superior guidance for community interventions.

### 1.1.2 Evolution of Clinical Prediction and SDOH Integration

Clinical risk prediction has evolved from simple scoring systems to sophisticated SDOH-enhanced models. Traditional approaches like the Framingham Risk Score (cardiovascular disease), APACHE score (ICU mortality), and LACE Index (readmission risk) rely on limited clinical variables and demonstrate inconsistent performance across diverse populations, particularly underestimating risk in socially disadvantaged groups (McNeill et al., 2023; Rajkomar et al., 2018).

These traditional models typically incorporate few variables, assume linear relationships, rarely include social determinants, and often show significant performance disparities across demographic groups (Rajkomar et al., 2018). Recent approaches preserve interpretability while enhancing prediction through machine learning techniques and SDOH integration. Chen et al. (2020) demonstrated that readmission models enhanced with SDOH factors improved AUROC by 0.08-0.12 compared to traditional clinical models.

Key developments enabling this evolution include widespread EHR implementation creating unprecedented data resources, advances in neural networks enabling processing of unstructured documentation, and growing recognition of algorithmic bias prompting fairness-aware techniques (Rajkomar et al., 2018).

### 1.1.3 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Healthcare

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies have transformed healthcare analytics, enabling systems to autonomously identify patterns, adapt to new information, and generate predictive insights (Miotto et al., 2018). Machine learning methods for SDOH-enhanced prediction span from traditional statistical approaches to sophisticated deep learning architectures. Traditional supervised learning methods remain relevant due to their interpretability and clinical acceptance. Logistic regression provides interpretable coefficients for clinical decision-making (Goldstein et al., 2017), while random forests effectively capture non-linear relationships between social determinants and outcomes (Chen et al., 2020). Gradient boosting models like XGBoost consistently demonstrate strong performance for prediction tasks incorporating structured clinical and social data (Segar et al., 2022). Unsupervised learning methods identify latent patient subgroups defined by social risk profiles, with clustering algorithms discovering natural patient groupings based on SDOH patterns and dimensionality reduction techniques transforming high-dimensional social determinant data into efficient representations while preserving structure (Char et al., 2018).

Deep learning approaches have revolutionized SDOH integration by enabling sophisticated processing of unstructured data. Recurrent Neural Networks model temporal dependencies, valuable for tracking how changing social circumstances influence clinical trajectories (Rashid et al., 2024). Transformer-based models extract SDOH information from clinical notes by capturing contextual relationships in text, while Graph Neural Networks model relationships between patients, providers, and social factors as networks, particularly useful for analyzing how social connections influence health outcomes (Ong et al., 2024). Multi-modal approaches integrate diverse data sources, combining structured clinical data with unstructured documentation and community-level indicators (Abbott et al., 2024).

The effective application of these AI/ML methods to SDOH requires specialized approaches throughout the modeling pipeline—from preprocessing and feature engineering to validation and implementation. These methodological considerations become increasingly important as healthcare organizations seek to develop prediction systems that not only achieve high performance but also ensure fairness, generalizability, and practical utility across diverse populations.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite technological advances in healthcare AI and recognition of SDOH's impact, a critical disconnect persists between these domains. Traditional clinical prediction models remain constrained by limited capacity to incorporate non-clinical factors that profoundly influence health trajectories (Chen et al., 2020). This manifests in several challenges: current models demonstrate systematic performance disparities across demographic groups, with lower accuracy for socially disadvantaged populations (Rajkomar et al., 2018); data integration barriers between clinical and social domains fragment SDOH information across disconnected systems (Cantor & Thorpe, 2018); methodological approaches for incorporating social determinants into predictive architectures remain underdeveloped (Goldstein et al., 2017); and ethical concerns regarding fairness, privacy, and potential reinforcement of inequities raise implementation challenges (Obermeyer et al., 2019).

SDOH-enhanced models face distinctive technical challenges requiring specialized approaches. Class imbalance is pronounced when predicting outcomes strongly influenced by social factors, and feature selection becomes critical when integrating numerous potential social determinants with clinical variables (Islam et al., 2025). The consequences of not addressing these challenges are substantial. Models failing to account for social determinants risk perpetuating health disparities, directing resources away from populations with greatest need (Rajkomar et al., 2018). The economic burden of these disparities—estimated at $93 billion annually in the U.S.—continues to grow, with projections suggesting worldwide costs could reach $47 trillion by 2030 (Hacker, 2024).

## 1.3 Purpose Statement

This comprehensive review addresses this critical gap by systematically examining the integration of social determinants of health with artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches for healthcare prediction. Through systematic search of multiple databases and structured inclusion criteria, we identified X studies meeting our review parameters. Our purpose is to analyze the current state of SDOH-AI integration across healthcare domains, identifying effective methodological approaches, data sources, and implementation strategies.

We evaluate performance improvements achieved through SDOH-enhanced models compared to traditional clinical approaches, with particular attention to generalizability across diverse populations—a critical consideration for healthcare equity. Additionally, we develop frameworks for ethical implementation addressing algorithmic fairness, privacy considerations, and health equity implications.

Our analysis explores four central questions: (1) How social determinant data are being integrated with AI/ML predictive models across healthcare domains and what specific data sources are utilized; (2) What methodological approaches have been developed for extracting and representing SDOH information in computational systems; (3) How SDOH-enhanced AI/ML models perform compared to traditional clinical models in terms of predictive accuracy, generalizability, and clinical utility; and (4) What ethical, technical, and implementation challenges exist, along with proposed strategies to address them.

While focusing on contemporary research, we intentionally incorporate foundational literature establishing core principles in both SDOH and AI/ML domains, recognizing that meaningful progress builds upon earlier contributions while adapting to evolving capabilities and healthcare needs.

### 1.3.1 Evaluation Approaches

Our review employs specialized metrics aligning with health equity goals and clinical utility. Beyond traditional statistical measures, we emphasize several complementary evaluation approaches. Discrimination metrics quantify a model's ability to separate positive and negative cases across different social risk strata, including Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)—particularly informative for imbalanced outcomes common in socially vulnerable populations (Goldstein et al., 2017). Calibration metrics assess whether predicted probabilities align with observed event rates across social risk categories, using calibration plots stratified by social determinant factors and Brier scores (Shah et al., 2024). Clinical utility metrics quantify the practical value of model predictions for decision-making compared to default strategies, with decision curve analysis and net benefit calculations increasingly stratified by social risk categories to ensure equitable benefit across populations (Rajkomar et al., 2019). Fairness metrics evaluate prediction parity across demographic groups, including equality of opportunity (similar true positive rates across groups), predictive parity (similar positive predictive values), and calibration equity (similar calibration across groups) (Rajkomar et al., 2018).

## 1.4 Significance and Contributions

### 1.4.1 Technical Innovations and Stakeholder Benefits

The integration of SDOH data with AI/ML approaches offers transformative potential across the healthcare ecosystem. SDOH-enhanced models consistently outperform traditional clinical approaches, with typical AUC improvements of 0.03-0.15 (Segar et al., 2022), demonstrating superior generalizability across diverse populations. Recent technical innovations have significantly advanced SDOH-AI integration. Large language models have substantially improved extraction of social determinant information from clinical documentation (Gu et al., 2025), while multimodal architectures synthesize diverse data types to create comprehensive patient profiles capturing both clinical and social vulnerability factors (Rashid et al., 2024). Interpretable AI approaches include hybrid architectures combining deep learning for feature extraction with interpretable methods for final prediction (Char et al., 2018), attention mechanisms highlighting when social factors significantly influence predicted outcomes (Snowdon et al., 2023), and counterfactual analysis examining how predictions would change under different social circumstances.

These advances benefit multiple stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem. Clinicians gain more accurate risk prediction tools that account for patients' social context, enabling more targeted interventions and personalized care plans. Healthcare systems can better allocate limited resources for prevention and intervention, improving efficiency and effectiveness of care delivery. Policymakers receive evidence for targeted program development and funding, supporting data-driven decisions about community investments and social services. Patients benefit from more equitable care that considers their full life circumstances, potentially reducing disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. Researchers identify new intervention opportunities to address health disparities, advancing knowledge about the complex interactions between social factors and health outcomes.

### 1.4.2 Review Contributions

This review differentiates itself through four key contributions. First, we provide a comprehensive analysis spanning foundational concepts through recent methodological innovations, examining both cutting-edge research and seminal works across SDOH and AI/ML domains. Second, we deliver detailed technical analysis of emerging methodological approaches, including large language models, multimodal architectures, and explainable AI techniques for SDOH integration. Third, we systematically evaluate performance across diverse populations, focusing on generalizability and equity implications—a critical consideration often overlooked in technical reviews. Fourth, we develop a comprehensive framework for ethical implementation addressing bias, fairness, and equity throughout the AI development lifecycle, providing practical guidance for researchers, developers, and healthcare organizations.

Advanced SDOH-enhanced prediction models incorporating contextual understanding alongside technical innovation represent the leading edge of healthcare AI development. These systems recognize that accurate prediction requires comprehending not only clinical condition but also social circumstances that profoundly shape health trajectories. In the following sections, we first examine the diverse landscape of SDOH data sources and integration methods, then analyze specialized AI/ML methodologies for incorporating these social determinants into healthcare prediction, and finally explore applications, performance, and implementation considerations across healthcare domains.
