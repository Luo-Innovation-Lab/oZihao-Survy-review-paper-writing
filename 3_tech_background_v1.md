# 3. Technical Background

## 3.1 SDOH Conceptual Models

Social determinants of health (SDOH) represent a critical paradigm for understanding the complex interplay between social, economic, and environmental factors that shape health outcomes. Several prominent frameworks have been developed to conceptualize and categorize these determinants, each offering distinct perspectives and applications for health research and policy. These frameworks provide essential conceptual foundations for the computational approaches discussed later in this paper.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has established one of the most influential and widely adopted frameworks for understanding social determinants of health. Developed by the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, this framework conceptualizes health inequities as arising from the "causes of the causes" - the fundamental structures of social hierarchy and conditions that shape how people live, work, grow, and age (World Health Organization Commission on Social Determinants of Health, 2008). The WHO framework distinguishes between structural determinants (socioeconomic and political context, including governance, policy, cultural and societal norms) and intermediary determinants (material circumstances, psychosocial factors, behavioral factors, biological factors, and the health system itself). This hierarchical model explicitly acknowledges the causal pathways through which social conditions influence health outcomes, making it particularly valuable for policy development and systems-level interventions (Marmot, 2005). A key strength of the WHO framework is its global applicability and explicit focus on health equity. By positioning social determinants within broader socioeconomic and political contexts, this model facilitates cross-national comparisons and highlights the structural nature of health disparities, providing a common language for addressing social determinants across diverse healthcare and social welfare systems (World Health Organization, 2023).

In the United States, the Healthy People 2030 initiative has developed a comprehensive framework that organizes social determinants into five key domains: Economic Stability, Education Access and Quality, Healthcare Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context. This model has gained significant traction in both research and clinical applications due to its structured approach and alignment with U.S. health policy priorities (Hacker et al., 2021). The Economic Stability domain encompasses poverty, employment status, food security, and housing stability, recognizing that financial resources fundamentally determine individuals' ability to meet basic needs. Education Access and Quality includes educational attainment, literacy, early childhood education, and vocational training, acknowledging education's role as both a direct health determinant and a mediator for other social factors. Healthcare Access and Quality focuses on insurance coverage, provider availability, affordability, health literacy, and care quality. The Neighborhood and Built Environment domain encompasses housing quality, transportation infrastructure, environmental conditions, safety, and access to nutritious foods. Finally, Social and Community Context addresses social integration, support systems, civic participation, discrimination experiences, and interactions with justice systems. The Healthy People 2030 framework provides a structured approach for data collection, intervention design, and outcome measurement that aligns with existing U.S. health policy initiatives, facilitating its adoption across diverse implementation contexts (Teshale et al., 2023).

The Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) has developed a complementary classification system that places greater emphasis on the interrelationships between determinants across different ecological levels. This framework distinguishes between upstream factors (social, economic, and physical conditions), midstream factors (health behaviors and psychosocial factors), and downstream factors (physiological and biological pathways), highlighting the cascading influence of social conditions on health outcomes. The IOM framework is particularly valuable for understanding causal pathways and mechanisms through which social determinants influence health, supporting more nuanced research designs and intervention approaches that target specific causal links rather than isolated factors (Matheny et al., 2019). This ecological perspective has proven especially valuable for implementation research examining how social interventions translate into measurable health improvements.

Recent comparative analyses have examined the relative strengths and limitations of these frameworks across different implementation contexts. Chen and colleagues (2020) found that the Healthy People 2030 domains provided the most practical structure for organizing SDOH data within electronic health records, while the WHO framework offered superior guidance for community-level interventions addressing structural barriers. McNeill and colleagues (2023) observed that cardiovascular disease prevention initiatives benefited from the IOM's emphasis on causal pathways, allowing more targeted interventions addressing specific mechanisms linking social conditions to cardiovascular outcomes. Snowdon and colleagues (2023) further noted that the selection of SDOH variables in AI-based cardiovascular risk models was frequently guided by these established frameworks, with variable selection significantly impacting model performance across different demographic groups.

The optimal framework selection depends fundamentally on the intended application. Clinical screening and documentation protocols typically align most closely with the Healthy People 2030 domains due to their operational specificity. Population health management initiatives frequently adopt the WHO framework's emphasis on structural determinants to guide community-level interventions. Research studies often integrate elements from multiple frameworks to capture both structural influences and specific causal pathways (Whitman et al., 2022). As the field of SDOH-enhanced AI prediction advances, these conceptual frameworks provide essential guidance for variable selection, feature engineering, and interpretation of model outputs.

## 3.2 AI/ML Foundations for Healthcare

The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare represents a profound technological transformation that has rapidly advanced over the past decade. Understanding the fundamental approaches, architectures, and evaluation methods is essential for contextualizing current applications in SDOH-enhanced prediction. This section examines key machine learning paradigms, deep learning architectures, and evaluation approaches that have transformed healthcare prediction.

Machine learning approaches in healthcare can be broadly categorized into supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms, each with distinct applications and strengths for clinical prediction tasks. Supervised learning, the predominant paradigm in healthcare prediction, enables algorithms to learn mapping relationships between inputs (features) and outputs (targets) based on labeled training examples. In clinical contexts, these approaches typically focus on classification problems (predicting categorical outcomes like hospital readmission) or regression problems (predicting continuous values like length of stay) (Rajkomar et al., 2019). Several traditional supervised learning methods have demonstrated particular utility in healthcare contexts. Despite its relative simplicity, logistic regression remains widely used due to its interpretability and established clinical acceptance, providing readily interpretable coefficients that clinicians can incorporate into decision-making (Goldstein et al., 2017). Random forests and other ensemble methods combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance while mitigating individual tree overfitting, demonstrating particular utility for healthcare data with complex, non-linear relationships between predictors and outcomes (Chen et al., 2020). Support vector machines identify optimal boundaries separating different outcome categories in high-dimensional feature spaces, proving especially valuable for applications with limited training data but numerous potential predictors (Miotto et al., 2018). Gradient boosting models like XGBoost and LightGBM have consistently demonstrated strong performance across diverse healthcare prediction tasks, particularly for structured clinical data (Segar et al., 2022).

Supervised learning approaches in healthcare face several distinctive challenges that ongoing research continues to address. Class imbalance occurs when outcome events of interest are rare, potentially biasing models toward the majority class and limiting sensitivity for detecting critical health events. Feature selection challenges arise when identifying the most relevant predictors from thousands of potential clinical and social variables. These algorithms must also produce explainable predictions that clinicians can trust and interpret, a requirement that has driven development of model-agnostic explanation frameworks (Rajkomar et al., 2019). A comprehensive review by Islam and colleagues (2025) identified that combining clinical data with social determinants variables requires specialized preprocessing approaches to handle different variable types, distributions, and missing data patterns, particularly for chronic disease prediction models.

Unsupervised learning methods identify patterns and structures in data without labeled outcomes, serving critical functions in healthcare analytics. These approaches are particularly valuable for discovering latent patient subgroups, identifying novel risk factors, and preprocessing complex healthcare data before supervised analysis (Miotto et al., 2018). Key unsupervised approaches in healthcare include clustering algorithms (k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN) that identify natural patient groupings based on feature similarity. These methods have proven valuable for patient stratification, phenotype discovery, and healthcare resource planning. Dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and UMAP transform high-dimensional healthcare data into lower-dimensional representations while preserving meaningful structure, supporting visualization, feature extraction, and computational efficiency for subsequent supervised learning (Char et al., 2018). Anomaly detection algorithms identify unusual patterns that may indicate errors, outliers, or clinically significant events requiring attention, demonstrating utility for quality control, fraud detection, and identification of unusual disease presentations (Hobensack et al., 2025).

The evaluation of machine learning models in healthcare requires specialized metrics that align with clinical priorities and decision-making contexts. Beyond traditional statistical measures like accuracy, healthcare applications emphasize discrimination metrics like Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC), which quantifies a model's ability to separate positive and negative cases, and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), which provides more informative evaluation for imbalanced outcomes common in healthcare (Goldstein et al., 2017). Calibration metrics assess whether predicted probabilities align with observed event rates, critical for risk communication and treatment planning. Methods include calibration plots, Hosmer-Lemeshow tests, and Brier scores (Shah et al., 2024). Clinical utility metrics like decision curve analysis and net benefit calculations quantify the practical value of model predictions for clinical decision-making compared to default strategies like "treat all" or "treat none" approaches (Rajkomar et al., 2019). Fairness metrics have become increasingly essential for SDOH-enhanced models, evaluating prediction parity across different demographic groups and assessing whether models maintain consistent performance across diverse populations (Rajkomar et al., 2018).

Deep learning approaches have rapidly transformed healthcare analytics, enabling more sophisticated processing of complex, unstructured data types that characterize modern healthcare environments. Several neural network architectures have demonstrated particular utility for healthcare applications involving social determinants. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), originally developed for image processing, have revolutionized medical imaging analysis across radiology, pathology, dermatology, and ophthalmology. These architectures use hierarchical feature extraction through convolutional layers to identify relevant patterns at multiple scales (Miotto et al., 2018). Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) architectures process sequential healthcare data such as longitudinal electronic health records, time series from monitoring devices, and event sequences. Their ability to model temporal dependencies makes them particularly valuable for predicting clinical deterioration and disease progression, especially when incorporating time-varying social factors (Rashid et al., 2024).

Transformer-based models, originally developed for natural language processing, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for healthcare applications involving unstructured text, temporal data, and multimodal inputs. Their ability to capture long-range dependencies has proven especially valuable for processing complex clinical narratives containing SDOH information. Recent work by Gu and colleagues (2025) demonstrated that large language models can extract social determinant information from unstructured clinical documentation with unprecedented accuracy (F1 scores above 0.95), automatically structuring information about housing, employment, substance use, and social support. Scherbakov and colleagues (2025) further demonstrated that AI-assisted extraction of SDOH factors from mental health records yielded novel insights into the relationship between social determinants and treatment outcomes. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model relationships between entities (patients, providers, diagnoses) as graphs, enabling sophisticated analysis of healthcare networks and knowledge structures. They have demonstrated particular utility for modeling complex relationships between social determinants and clinical outcomes (Ong et al., 2024).

Transfer learning has emerged as a particularly valuable strategy for healthcare applications, allowing knowledge transfer from models trained on large datasets to specific clinical tasks with limited labeled data. This approach has proven especially valuable for specialized clinical applications where obtaining large labeled datasets is challenging (Miotto et al., 2018). Common transfer learning strategies in healthcare include pre-trained feature extractors, domain adaptation techniques that modify pre-trained models to perform well on target domains with different data distributions, and most recently, large foundation models fine-tuned for specific healthcare tasks. These approaches are particularly valuable for SDOH-enhanced prediction models, as they allow knowledge transfer between similar social determinant contexts while accommodating institution-specific documentation practices and population characteristics (Gu et al., 2025).

Healthcare data inherently spans multiple modalities, including structured EHR data, clinical notes, medical images, genomic information, and increasingly, social determinant indicators. Multi-modal learning approaches integrate these diverse data sources to develop more comprehensive and accurate predictive models (Rashid et al., 2024). Key integration strategies include early fusion (combining features from different modalities before model training), late fusion (training separate models for each modality and combining their outputs), and hybrid approaches that combine modality-specific processing with intermediate integration layers. In SDOH-enhanced prediction specifically, multi-modal learning enables integration of structured clinical data, unstructured documentation containing social context, and community-level indicators derived from geographic information. This comprehensive approach provides more nuanced understanding of both clinical and social risk factors than single-modality models, as demonstrated in recent work by Abbott and colleagues (2024), who developed multi-modal models for emergency department utilization that integrated clinical data, SDOH factors, and neighborhood characteristics.

## 3.3 Predictive Modeling in Healthcare

Healthcare predictive modeling has evolved significantly, transitioning from traditional clinical risk scores to sophisticated AI-driven approaches that increasingly incorporate social determinants of health. This progression reflects both technological advances and growing recognition of the complex, multifactorial nature of health outcomes.

Clinical risk prediction has historically relied on scoring systems derived from statistical analysis of specific clinical variables. These traditional approaches typically use logistic regression or similar techniques to identify significant predictors and assign weighted scores based on their associations with outcomes of interest (Goldstein et al., 2017). Notable examples include the Framingham Risk Score for cardiovascular disease risk prediction, which uses demographic factors and clinical parameters including blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking status. Despite its widespread adoption, the Framingham score has demonstrated inconsistent performance across diverse populations, particularly underestimating risk in socially disadvantaged groups (McNeill et al., 2023). The APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) score is used to predict mortality risk in intensive care settings based on physiological measurements, age, and comorbidities. While valuable for severity adjustment, this model incorporates minimal social context despite substantial evidence that post-ICU outcomes depend heavily on social support and resource access. The LACE Index predicts 30-day readmission risk using Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidities, and Emergency department visits, but fails to account for social factors that significantly influence readmission risk, including housing instability, transportation access, and social support availability. Similarly, the CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score stratifies stroke risk in atrial fibrillation patients based on clinical and demographic factors, but research indicates its performance varies substantially across neighborhood socioeconomic strata, suggesting unaccounted social determinants moderate stroke risk beyond included variables.

These traditional scoring systems share several common limitations. They typically incorporate a limited number of variables, constraining their ability to capture complex risk patterns. They generally assume linear relationships between predictors and outcomes, potentially missing important non-linear interactions. They rarely incorporate social determinants despite substantial evidence of their predictive value. And they often demonstrate significant performance disparities across demographic groups, partly due to their omission of social context (Rajkomar et al., 2018). Despite these limitations, traditional risk scores offer several advantages that have sustained their clinical utilization: they provide transparent, interpretable predictions that clinicians can calculate without complex computational infrastructure; they align with established clinical workflows and documentation practices; and they often have extensive validation across multiple cohorts, providing confidence in their general utility despite recognized performance gaps.

Recent approaches have sought to preserve the interpretability of traditional risk scores while enhancing their predictive performance through machine learning techniques. These hybrid methods typically maintain a similar format to established scores but employ more sophisticated modeling techniques for variable selection and weighting (Goldstein et al., 2017). Integration strategies include machine learning extensions that maintain the basic structure of established risk scores but use advanced algorithms like random forests or gradient boosting to identify optimal variable combinations and weightings. Chen and colleagues (2020) demonstrated that machine learning extensions of readmission risk models that incorporated SDOH factors improved AUROC by 0.08-0.12 compared to traditional clinical models. Risk score calibration uses machine learning techniques to adjust traditional scores for specific populations or settings, addressing known performance gaps while preserving the familiar scoring framework. Ensemble methods combine predictions from traditional risk scores with machine learning models, leveraging clinical expertise embedded in established scores while capturing complex patterns identified by algorithmic approaches. Islam and colleagues (2025) showed that an explainable machine learning model incorporating SDOH variables improved chronic kidney disease prediction in type 2 diabetes patients, with SDOH factors contributing significantly to model performance. Their transparent approach allowed clinicians to understand how social factors interacted with clinical variables to influence risk predictions.

The historical trajectory of clinical prediction has progressed through several distinct phases. First-generation models (1960s-1990s) consisted of simple scoring systems based on linear statistical models using limited clinical variables, exemplified by the Framingham Risk Score, which used straightforward calculation methods accessible without computational assistance. Second-generation approaches (1990s-2010s) featured expanded variable sets and more sophisticated statistical methods, including logistic regression with interaction terms and time-varying covariates, though these models remained primarily focused on clinical parameters. Third-generation models (2010s-Present) leverage machine learning approaches to process diverse data types, including structured EHR data, medical imaging, and unstructured clinical text. These models demonstrate superior predictive performance but often present interpretability challenges for clinical implementation (Miotto et al., 2018). The emerging fourth generation of clinical prediction models incorporates social determinants, multimodal data fusion, and explainable AI techniques. These advanced models address both performance and implementation considerations, supporting more equitable and contextually aware prediction (Segar et al., 2022).

Several pivotal developments have accelerated progress in clinical prediction. The HITECH Act (2009) drove rapid electronic health record implementation across U.S. healthcare systems, creating unprecedented data resources for model development. This transition fundamentally changed the scale and scope of available training data for predictive models. Advances in neural network architectures, particularly convolutional and recurrent networks (2012-2016), enabled more sophisticated processing of complex healthcare data, including medical imaging and temporal sequences. Transformer-based models revolutionized clinical text processing (2018-2022), enabling more accurate extraction of critical information from unstructured documentation, including social determinant mentions (Gu et al., 2025). Advanced architectural approaches enabled effective integration of diverse data modalities (2020-Present), supporting more comprehensive patient representation incorporating both clinical and social context (Rashid et al., 2024). Growing recognition of algorithmic bias prompted development of techniques specifically designed to ensure prediction parity across demographic groups (2018-Present), particularly critical for models incorporating social determinants (Rajkomar et al., 2018). These developments collectively enabled the current generation of SDOH-enhanced prediction models that integrate diverse data sources while addressing equity and implementation considerations.

Contemporary clinical prediction increasingly employs sophisticated approaches that balance predictive performance with implementation considerations. Hybrid models combine the strengths of different prediction approaches, often using deep learning for feature extraction while employing more interpretable methods for final prediction to maintain performance while enhancing explainability (Char et al., 2018). Attention-based mechanisms identify and highlight the most relevant features for specific predictions, providing transparency about which factors most strongly influence model outputs. For SDOH-enhanced models, attention mechanisms can highlight when social factors significantly influence predicted outcomes, as demonstrated by Snowdon and colleagues (2023) in their review of AI models for cardiovascular disease that incorporate social determinants. Self-supervised learning techniques leverage unlabeled data to learn useful representations before supervised fine-tuning for specific prediction tasks, particularly valuable for extracting informative patterns from vast EHR repositories containing limited outcome labels. Federated learning enables model training across multiple institutions without data sharing, addressing privacy concerns while leveraging diverse patient populations (Rashid et al., 2024). For SDOH research, this approach facilitates collaboration between healthcare systems serving different communities. Counterfactual analysis examines how predictions would change under different circumstances, supporting more nuanced understanding of causal relationships between risk factors and outcomes. For SDOH-enhanced models, counterfactual analysis can illuminate how specific social interventions might influence predicted trajectories.

Current state-of-the-art approaches increasingly emphasize not only prediction accuracy but also fairness, interpretability, and practical clinical utility. This holistic perspective acknowledges that successful clinical prediction requires addressing the full sociotechnical context of healthcare delivery, not merely maximizing statistical performance metrics (Matheny et al., 2019). Recent projections from academic research indicate substantial growth in AI applications for healthcare, with increased focus on models that incorporate social determinants to improve prediction accuracy and address health disparities (Ong et al., 2024). Meta-analytic findings indicate that SDOH-enhanced models typically demonstrate AUC improvements ranging from 0.03 to 0.15 compared to clinical-only models, with particularly strong performance improvements observed in cardiovascular disease prediction, hospital readmission risk, and diabetes-related outcomes (Segar et al., 2022). The most advanced SDOH-enhanced prediction models incorporate sophisticated contextual understanding alongside technical innovation, recognizing that accurate prediction requires comprehending not only the patient's clinical condition but also their social circumstances, environmental exposures, and resource access.

Despite these advances, significant implementation challenges remain. Ethical considerations present perhaps the most profound challenge when incorporating social determinants into clinical prediction models. Without careful implementation, SDOH-enhanced prediction systems risk perpetuating or even amplifying existing health disparities through several mechanisms. The inclusion of variables correlated with race or socioeconomic status without appropriate safeguards may create 'algorithmic redlining' effects, whereby predictive systems inadvertently direct resources away from historically marginalized communities that would benefit most from intervention (Obermeyer et al., 2019). Data fragmentation presents another substantial barrier to SDOH integration, as relevant information typically exists across multiple disconnected systems with limited interoperability. Most commercial EHR platforms were developed primarily to support clinical documentation and billing processes, with social factor documentation capabilities added as secondary features rather than core functionalities (Cantor & Thorpe, 2018). Nevertheless, the continued advancement of AI techniques coupled with growing recognition of SDOH importance suggests that integrated clinical-social models will play an increasingly central role in healthcare delivery, resource allocation, and population health management.
