# 11. Conclusion

The integration of social determinants of health (SDOH) with artificial intelligence and machine learning represents a paradigm shift in healthcare prediction and intervention planning. This systematic review has examined the evolving landscape of SDOH-enhanced AI/ML applications, revealing both significant progress and critical areas requiring further development. By synthesizing findings across technical, clinical, and implementation domains, we offer a comprehensive assessment of the field's current state and future trajectory.

## Synthesis of Key Findings

The collective evidence demonstrates that SDOH-enhanced prediction models consistently outperform traditional clinical-only approaches across diverse healthcare contexts. Meta-analytic findings indicate typical AUC improvements ranging from 0.03 to 0.15 compared to clinical-only models, with particularly substantial gains observed in chronic disease management, readmission prediction, and population health applications (Segar et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2020). This performance advantage stems from SDOH factors' ability to capture critical variance in health outcomes that remains unexplained by clinical parameters alone.

The field has undergone rapid methodological evolution, progressing from simple regression models incorporating area-level socioeconomic indices to sophisticated deep learning architectures that integrate multiple SDOH data modalities. Particularly noteworthy is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) that can extract social determinant information from unstructured clinical documentation with unprecedented accuracy (Gu et al., 2025; Shi et al., 2025). These technical advances have been accompanied by significant progress in data standardization, with efforts like FHIR-based SDOH resources and standardized screening tools facilitating more consistent representation across systems (Arons et al., 2019; Golembiewski et al., 2022).

The field's implementation maturity varies substantially across application domains and healthcare contexts. While research implementations demonstrate technical feasibility and performance advantages, operational deployments face significant challenges related to workflow integration, data fragmentation, and sustainability. Studies by Gold et al. (2022) and Hahn-Goldberg et al. (2024) provide valuable frameworks for addressing these implementation barriers, emphasizing the importance of leadership engagement, clear governance structures, and user-centered design approaches.

Despite these advances, critical knowledge gaps persist. The longitudinal dynamics of social determinants remain inadequately modeled, with most approaches treating SDOH as static rather than evolving factors (Liu et al., 2024; Melvin et al., 2023). Causal pathways linking social factors to health outcomes are insufficiently understood, limiting development of targeted interventions. Patient-centered SDOH conceptualization remains underdeveloped, with most models reflecting healthcare system priorities rather than patient perspectives on their social circumstances (Thompson et al., 2024). These gaps represent important targets for future research.

## Answers to Research Questions

Returning to our initial research questions, we offer the following evidence-based conclusions:

**How are SDOH data being integrated with AI/ML predictive models?** 
Integration approaches span multiple methodological families, including traditional statistical models, tree-based ensembles, and deep learning architectures. Area-level SDOH data from census and community sources are typically integrated as features within model architecture or as post-processing stratification variables. Individual-level SDOH data are incorporated through structured screening results, NLP-extracted concepts from clinical notes, and increasingly through novel digital biomarkers derived from mobile health applications and sensors. The predominant technical approach involves feature-level integration within model architecture, though some implementations employ ensemble methods that combine separate clinical and social risk scores.

**What are the current approaches for extracting and representing SDOH in computational systems?**
Extraction methods include structured screening using validated instruments like PRAPARE, NLP-based extraction from clinical narratives, linkage with area-level indices, and emerging approaches using consumer-generated digital data. Representation approaches range from simple categorical variables to sophisticated embedding techniques that capture complex relationships between social factors. Standardization remains limited, with substantial variation in coding practices, terminology, and data models across implementations. Recent efforts toward FHIR-based SDOH standards, common data models, and standardized screening protocols represent important progress toward interoperability, though significant gaps remain in representing SDOH interventions and referrals.

**How do SDOH-enhanced AI/ML models perform compared to traditional clinical models?**
SDOH-enhanced models consistently demonstrate superior performance across diverse prediction tasks and healthcare contexts. Performance advantages are most pronounced for utilization outcomes including emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and readmissions, with more modest improvements observed for mortality prediction. Meta-analytic findings indicate that SDOH-enhanced models typically demonstrate AUC improvements ranging from 0.03 to 0.15 compared to clinical-only models (Segar et al., 2022). Individual-level SDOH data generally contribute more substantial performance improvements than area-level measures, highlighting the importance of collecting person-specific social information. Performance advantages vary across demographic groups, with some evidence suggesting greater impact among historically underserved populations.

**What ethical and implementation challenges exist in this field?**
Ethical challenges include privacy concerns regarding sensitive social information, potential for algorithmic bias and discrimination, risks of reinforcing stereotypes, and questions about appropriate intervention responsibilities when social needs are identified. These challenges are particularly acute when algorithms influence resource allocation or treatment decisions. Implementation challenges span technical, organizational, and policy domains, including workflow integration, data fragmentation across sectors, variable data quality, limited standardization, and sustainability concerns. Successful implementations address these challenges through stakeholder engagement, robust governance frameworks, careful attention to ethical implications, and sustainable funding models aligned with value-based care approaches.

## Practical Implications

For **researchers**, this review highlights high-priority areas for further investigation, including developing methods for longitudinal SDOH modeling, advancing causal inference approaches linking social factors to outcomes, creating standardized frameworks for fairness evaluation, and designing implementation approaches tailored to diverse healthcare contexts. Methodological innovation should focus on addressing current limitations in SDOH representation, temporal modeling, and transparency while maintaining strong performance.

For **healthcare organizations**, our findings underscore the importance of systematic SDOH data collection, standardization, and integration into clinical workflows. Organizations should invest in robust data infrastructure, develop clear governance frameworks for SDOH data, implement standardized screening protocols, and create sustainable partnerships with community-based organizations. Implementation should proceed incrementally, focusing initially on high-impact applications while building organizational capacity and stakeholder support.

For **policymakers**, this review demonstrates the need for supporting SDOH data standardization, facilitating cross-sector data sharing with appropriate privacy protections, aligning payment models with SDOH-informed care approaches, and developing regulatory frameworks that promote innovation while protecting against potential harms. Policies should address both technical standards for interoperability and financial incentives for addressing identified social needs.

For **technology developers**, our analysis suggests focusing on improving usability, workflow integration, and explainability of SDOH-enhanced prediction tools. Development should prioritize interoperability with existing healthcare and social service systems, addressing current standardization gaps, and creating more robust approaches for longitudinal modeling of changing social circumstances.

## Future Vision

Looking ahead, we envision significant evolution in this field across three complementary dimensions. Technically, we anticipate development of more sophisticated approaches for modeling complex interactions between social and clinical factors, capturing longitudinal SDOH dynamics, and enabling causal inference that supports targeted intervention. Organizationally, we expect continued progress toward systematic integration of SDOH assessment within clinical workflows, supported by evolving payment models that recognize and reward comprehensive approaches to patient care. Societally, we foresee growing emphasis on addressing structural determinants of health inequity through multi-level interventions that combine individual-level precision with population-level initiatives addressing systemic barriers.

The realization of this vision requires sustained collaborative effort across disciplines, sectors, and stakeholder groups. By combining methodological innovation, implementation science, community engagement, and policy development, the field can advance toward more equitable, effective healthcare systems that recognize and address the full spectrum of factors influencing health outcomes. Through such approaches, SDOH-enhanced AI/ML applications can fulfill their potential to meaningfully reduce health disparities while improving outcomes across populations.

The journey from research innovation to widespread clinical implementation involves substantial challenges, but the evidence synthesized in this review demonstrates both the feasibility and value of this approach. By thoughtfully addressing current limitations while building on promising foundations, the integration of social determinants with artificial intelligence can substantively contribute to more equitable, effective healthcare systems that recognize and address the full complexity of human health.

## Limitations

This review has several limitations worth noting. First, the rapid evolution of AI/ML methods means that some recent technical innovations may not be fully reflected. Second, publication bias may limit representation of unsuccessful implementation efforts, potentially overestimating practical feasibility. Third, our focus on English-language literature may underrepresent important work from non-English speaking countries. Fourth, the heterogeneity of outcome measures, modeling approaches, and evaluation metrics complicates direct comparison across studies. These limitations suggest the importance of ongoing systematic reviews as the field continues to develop.
