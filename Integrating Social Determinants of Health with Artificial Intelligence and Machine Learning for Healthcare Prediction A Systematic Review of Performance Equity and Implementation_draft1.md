# Integrating Social Determinants of Health with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Healthcare Prediction: A Systematic Review of Performance, Equity, and Implementation

## Abstract

**Background:** Social determinants of health (SDOH) account for 80-90% of modifiable health factors, yet their integration with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) for healthcare prediction remains underexplored. This systematic review examines the current state of SDOH-AI/ML integration, methodological approaches, performance characteristics, and implementation challenges in healthcare prediction.

**Methods:** Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search across PubMed (1,007 records) and Google Scholar (19,100 records) from January 2020 through March 2025. After systematic screening and eligibility assessment using predetermined criteria focusing on SDOH integration within AI/ML predictive modeling frameworks, 69 studies were included (67 original research articles and 2 methodological reviews). Data extraction captured study characteristics, SDOH variables, AI/ML methodologies, performance metrics, and implementation evidence using a standardized framework designed specifically for SDOH-AI research.

**Results:** SDOH-enhanced AI/ML models demonstrated consistent and substantial performance improvements across all clinical domains examined. Area under the curve improvements ranged from 0.02 to 0.08, with individual studies achieving far greater gains. Cardiovascular prediction models showed C-statistic improvements from 0.76-0.79 (clinical-only) to 0.81-0.84 (SDOH-enhanced), while achieving near-perfect calibration for racial and ethnic minorities (observed-to-expected ratios approaching 1.0 versus 1.20-1.70 for traditional models). Mental health applications demonstrated particularly strong SDOH effects, with social determinant domains explaining over 90% of variance in depression and mental health indicators. Four primary SDOH integration approaches emerged: individual-level screening (23% of healthcare systems), community-level geocoding (universal coverage), natural language processing extraction (93.8% accuracy for SDOH identification), and multimodal data fusion. Advanced architectures including transformer-based models (BERT, GPT-4o) achieved macro-F1 scores exceeding 0.70 for SDOH extraction, while ensemble methods demonstrated superior performance for heterogeneous SDOH data processing. Real-world implementations achieved 78% provider acceptance rates and demonstrated measurable clinical impact including 23% mortality reduction among high social vulnerability patients and projected annual savings of $15.6 million for large health systems.

**Discussion:** Novel conceptual frameworks for SDOH-AI integration have emerged, including multidimensional SDOH clustering approaches, temporal dynamics modeling for real-time integration, multimodal data fusion architectures, and explainable AI frameworks specifically designed for social determinants. Critical analysis reveals that SDOH integration not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances algorithmic fairness, with bias reduction of up to 45% while maintaining clinical performance. However, implementation challenges persist, including data infrastructure requirements, workflow integration complexity, provider training needs, and economic sustainability considerations. The field has progressed from theoretical demonstration to practical deployment, with systematic implementation frameworks addressing clinical workflow integration, stakeholder engagement, and organizational change management.

**Conclusions:** The integration of SDOH with AI/ML represents a transformative advancement in healthcare prediction, delivering substantial improvements in both accuracy and equity across diverse clinical applications. Evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that SDOH-enhanced models consistently outperform clinical-only approaches while addressing longstanding healthcare disparities through improved algorithmic fairness. However, successful implementation requires sophisticated approaches addressing data standardization, clinical workflow integration, provider training, and economic sustainability. Future research priorities include developing standardized SDOH data models, advancing causal inference methods, implementing comprehensive bias detection frameworks, and establishing scalable deployment strategies. The convergence of technological capability, empirical evidence, and implementation experience positions SDOH-AI integration as a critical component of equitable, precision healthcare delivery systems.

## 1. Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies into healthcare prediction has undergone unprecedented transformation, marked by the recognition that social determinants of health (SDOH) represent fundamental variables for achieving equitable and accurate clinical prediction. SDOH encompass the complex conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age—including economic stability, education access, healthcare access, neighborhood environment, and social context—and are estimated to account for 80-90% of modifiable factors impacting health outcomes. The past five years have witnessed exponential growth in research demonstrating that SDOH-enhanced prediction models consistently and substantially outperform traditional clinical-only approaches across virtually all healthcare domains, with particularly pronounced improvements for historically underserved populations.

This transformation has been facilitated by the convergence of several technological and methodological advances that have fundamentally altered the landscape of predictive modeling in healthcare. The proliferation of large language models has revolutionized SDOH data extraction capabilities, with recent studies achieving macro-F1 scores exceeding 0.70 for identifying social determinant factors from unstructured electronic health record documentation (Gu et al., 2025; Han et al., 2022). Simultaneously, the development of sophisticated data integration pipelines enables seamless linking of individual clinical data with community-level social indicators, creating unprecedented opportunities for multimodal predictive modeling that captures both individual clinical characteristics and broader social context (Rashid et al., 2024). These technological innovations have established the foundation for a comprehensive transformation in predictive modeling capabilities, where the empirical evidence base for SDOH integration has expanded dramatically across clinical specialties, with consistent demonstrations of improved prediction accuracy, enhanced model fairness, and better identification of high-risk populations. Recent research has established that SDOH factors often carry equal or greater predictive weight than traditional clinical variables, particularly for outcomes with strong social mediators such as hospital readmissions, medication adherence, and preventable complications. This convergence of advanced natural language processing capabilities, robust multimodal data integration frameworks, and compelling empirical evidence establishes the comprehensive foundation for the systematic review presented in this paper, which synthesizes current knowledge, identifies methodological advances, and provides guidance for future research and implementation efforts in SDOH-enhanced predictive modeling.

Building upon these technological foundations, the empirical evidence for SDOH integration benefits has become overwhelming across diverse clinical applications. Foundational work by Hammond et al. (2020) analyzed 3,614 Medicare beneficiaries and revealed that traditional clinical risk models systematically underpredicted adverse outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities. Their analysis uncovered a concerning pattern where clinical outcomes among minorities were inversely related to cost, with traditional models that adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities substantially underpredicting all-cause hospitalization by 20% (O:E, 1.20) and cardiovascular hospitalization by 70% (O:E, 1.70) while overpredicting death by 21% (O:E, 0.79) (Hammond et al., 2020). Most remarkably, when SDOH variables were incorporated, the models achieved near-perfect calibration, with SDOH integration bringing observed-to-expected ratios near 1 for all outcomes. This research exposed what the authors termed a paradoxical relationship between clinical outcomes and costs among racial and ethnic minorities, demonstrating that while blacks and Hispanics had higher rates of cardiovascular hospitalization (incidence rate ratio, 1.78; P=0.012), they incurred similar annual costs ($−336, P=0.77) compared with whites, revealing systematic differences in healthcare access patterns (Hammond et al., 2020).

The profound implications of these foundational findings have been consistently validated and extended across numerous clinical domains and diverse patient populations. Segar et al. (2022) conducted a comprehensive analysis of 123,634 hospitalized heart failure patients in the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure registry, demonstrating that machine learning models incorporating zip code-level SDOH parameters achieved excellent discrimination with C-statistics of 0.81 for Black patients and 0.82 for non-Black patients in internal validation. Most significantly, the addition of SDOH variables was associated with better discrimination, prognostic utility, and model reclassification metrics specifically in Black patients (net reclassification improvement, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.14-0.30; P < .001) but not in non-Black patients, highlighting the differential impact of social determinants across racial groups (Segar et al., 2022). This race-specific benefit was further validated in external cohorts, with their models demonstrating robust generalizability across diverse populations while maintaining superior performance compared to traditional regression approaches.

Complementing these cardiovascular findings, Chen et al. (2020) analyzed 138,115 patients across three health systems and demonstrated that machine learning models using only socioeconomic determinants of health—age group, gender, race, and address-derived community characteristics—could predict inpatient and emergency department utilization with high discrimination. Their proprietary decision tree methodology revealed that it is possible to risk-stratify patients' healthcare utilization without clinical data, suggesting that SDOH factors alone carry substantial predictive power for healthcare outcomes (Chen et al., 2020). Similarly, Islam et al. (2025) evaluated seven machine learning models for chronic kidney disease prediction in 19,912 Type 2 diabetes patients, finding that random forest architectures incorporating SDOH achieved optimal performance with AUROC of 0.89, significantly outperforming traditional approaches while revealing that social determinants contributed 34% of total predictive power (Islam et al., 2025).

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Study Design and Search Strategy

This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines to ensure systematic and transparent identification, screening, and synthesis of studies investigating the integration of social determinants of health (SDOH) with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) approaches for healthcare prediction. The review protocol was developed a priori to capture the current state of SDOH-AI integration research while identifying key methodological approaches, performance characteristics, and implementation considerations through comprehensive literature search, rigorous study selection, standardized data extraction, and quality assessment procedures.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple electronic databases from January 2020 through March 2025, with two primary databases utilized to ensure comprehensive coverage of the rapidly evolving field. PubMed yielded 1,007 records while Google Scholar contributed 19,100 records, resulting in a total of 20,107 initial records for systematic evaluation. The search strategy employed comprehensive combinations of key terms organized around three conceptual domains that reflect the interdisciplinary nature of SDOH-AI integration research. The first domain encompassed social determinants terminology including "social determinants of health," "SDOH," "socioeconomic factors," and "health disparities," while the second domain captured artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts through terms such as "artificial intelligence," "machine learning," "deep learning," "predictive modeling," and "healthcare analytics." The third domain focused on healthcare prediction and risk assessment applications, ensuring that retrieved studies demonstrated clear clinical relevance and predictive modeling applications. Boolean operators were strategically employed to combine search terms effectively across these domains, creating comprehensive search strings that captured the intersection of social determinants, advanced computational methods, and healthcare prediction applications. The search timeframe was specifically chosen to capture the rapid evolution of SDOH-AI integration research while building upon foundational work established in previous systematic reviews, recognizing that this field has experienced accelerated growth in methodological sophistication during the period from 2020 to 2025 as both AI/ML techniques and SDOH data availability have matured significantly.

### 2.2 Study Selection and Eligibility Assessment

The study selection process implemented rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria designed to ensure the review captured high-quality research that demonstrated meaningful integration of SDOH variables within AI/ML predictive modeling frameworks for healthcare applications. Included studies were required to be original research articles published in peer-reviewed journals that explicitly integrated SDOH variables as major components in AI/ML predictive models for healthcare outcomes, with particular emphasis on research that incorporated at least one SDOH domain as defined by the Healthy People 2030 framework. This framework encompasses five critical domains including Economic Stability, Education Access and Quality, Healthcare Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context, providing a standardized structure for evaluating the comprehensiveness of SDOH integration across studies. Additionally, included studies were required to utilize AI/ML approaches for prediction or classification in clinical risk prediction, population health management, or health equity assessment, ensuring that the review focused on computationally sophisticated approaches rather than traditional statistical methods alone. Studies were further required to be published between January 2020 and March 2025, conducted in English, and provide sufficient methodological detail for quality assessment and data extraction procedures.

The exclusion criteria were equally rigorous and designed to eliminate studies that did not meet the review's focus on comprehensive SDOH-AI integration. Articles without available full text were excluded due to the inability to conduct thorough methodological assessment, while studies focusing on single SDOH factors without comprehensive integration into predictive modeling frameworks were eliminated to ensure the review captured approaches that recognized the multidimensional nature of social determinants. Research where SDOH variables were not major components in machine learning model development was excluded, as were review papers, commentaries, editorials, and conference abstracts, with the exception of a small number of selected review articles that presented critical methodological insights essential for understanding SDOH-AI/ML integration approaches. Studies focusing exclusively on clinical factors without meaningful SDOH integration were eliminated, as were descriptive analyses without predictive modeling components and non-healthcare applications lacking clinical relevance.

Following the initial database search yielding 20,107 records, duplicate removal was performed to eliminate redundant articles across databases, after which the remaining records underwent systematic screening through a carefully structured two-stage process. The first stage involved title and abstract screening against eligibility criteria, while the second stage comprised full-text assessment for final inclusion. The selection process prioritized original research studies that demonstrated comprehensive SDOH integration within AI/ML frameworks for healthcare prediction, with particular attention to methodological rigor, clinical applicability, and the potential to contribute meaningful insights to the understanding of how social determinants can enhance predictive modeling capabilities. Articles were excluded at various stages for multiple reasons including lack of full text availability, focus on single SDOH factors without comprehensive integration, SDOH variables not serving as major predictive components, and insufficient methodological detail for evaluation. A limited number of high-quality review papers were included when they presented critical methodological insights or frameworks essential for understanding SDOH-AI/ML integration approaches, resulting in a final selection of 69 studies comprising 67 original research articles and 2 selected review papers that provided essential methodological frameworks.

### 2.3 Data Extraction, Classification, and Quality Assessment

A standardized data extraction form was developed specifically for this review to systematically capture relevant information from included studies while ensuring consistency and completeness across the diverse literature examining SDOH-AI integration. Each study was classified along multiple dimensions using a comprehensive framework that recognized the multifaceted nature of SDOH-enhanced predictive modeling research. The classification system encompassed four primary dimensions including AI/ML methodological approaches, with categories for traditional machine learning methods, deep learning architectures, ensemble methods, and natural language processing techniques. The second dimension focused on SDOH domain coverage, evaluating whether studies addressed economic stability, education access and quality, healthcare access and quality, neighborhood and built environment factors, or social and community context variables. The third dimension examined data source characteristics, distinguishing between individual-level patient-reported data, area-level community indicators, multi-source integrated approaches, and clinical documentation extraction methodologies. The fourth dimension categorized healthcare application domains, including cardiovascular disease prediction, diabetes and metabolic disorders, cancer care applications, mental health outcomes, healthcare utilization prediction, and population health management initiatives.

The data extraction process captured comprehensive information including study characteristics such as author details, publication year, geographic location, and study design, along with detailed population demographics and sample sizes that reflected the diverse contexts in which SDOH-enhanced prediction has been implemented. Specific SDOH variables incorporated in each study were systematically documented, including both individual-level social determinants such as income, education, employment status, and housing conditions, as well as community-level factors such as neighborhood deprivation indices, food access metrics, and built environment characteristics. AI/ML methodology details were extensively recorded, including algorithm selection rationale, feature engineering approaches, model training and validation procedures, and performance optimization strategies. Outcome measures and performance metrics were systematically captured, with particular attention to area under the curve values, sensitivity and specificity measures, accuracy assessments, and calibration metrics, along with any reported fairness or equity evaluation results that demonstrated the impact of SDOH integration on model performance across diverse population subgroups.

Quality assessment procedures were implemented using criteria specifically adapted for predictive modeling research, recognizing that traditional systematic review quality assessment tools may not adequately capture the unique methodological considerations relevant to AI/ML applications in healthcare prediction. The assessment framework focused on four key domains that reflect critical aspects of high-quality predictive modeling research. The first domain evaluated participant selection and representativeness, assessing whether study populations were appropriate for the research questions and whether demographic diversity was sufficient to support generalizable conclusions. The second domain examined predictor variable definition and measurement quality, with particular attention to how SDOH variables were operationalized, measured, and validated within the predictive modeling framework. The third domain focused on outcome definition and assessment procedures, evaluating the clinical relevance and measurement validity of predicted outcomes. The fourth domain assessed analysis methodology including model development approaches, validation strategies, and fairness evaluation procedures, with particular emphasis on whether studies adequately addressed potential algorithmic bias and ensured equitable performance across diverse population groups. This comprehensive quality assessment approach enabled systematic evaluation of methodological rigor while recognizing the unique challenges and opportunities associated with integrating social determinants into AI/ML frameworks for healthcare prediction, ultimately supporting the identification of high-quality research that contributes meaningful insights to this rapidly evolving field.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Overall Characteristics of the Reviewed Studies

This section presents the comprehensive findings from our systematic analysis of 69 studies examining SDOH integration with AI/ML for predictive modeling in healthcare, organized into three key domains: technical background and conceptual frameworks for SDOH-AI integration, data sources and integration methodologies, and AI/ML methods for SDOH-enhanced prediction. The reviewed studies exhibited substantial diversity across multiple dimensions, demonstrating the breadth and complexity of current SDOH-AI research while revealing consistent performance improvements across diverse clinical applications through sophisticated methodological approaches for handling heterogeneous SDOH data and advanced techniques for ensuring equitable outcomes across population subgroups. Sample sizes ranged extensively from smaller cohorts of approximately 1,000 participants to large-scale population studies exceeding 200,000 individuals, with notable examples including Chen et al.'s analysis of 138,115 patients for healthcare utilization prediction, Segar et al.'s examination of 123,634 heart failure patients, and Islam et al.'s study of 19,912 patients for chronic kidney disease prediction, reflecting the scalability of SDOH-enhanced predictive modeling across diverse population contexts. Geographic distribution showed a predominant focus on United States-based populations (78% of studies), with significant representation from healthcare systems in New York City, California, and the Southeast, though international studies from Canada, Australia, and European nations provided important comparative perspectives that enhance the generalizability of findings across different healthcare systems and social contexts. Methodologically, the majority of studies (65%) employed cross-sectional designs, followed by retrospective cohort studies (29%) and prospective longitudinal designs (6%), reflecting the practical challenges of conducting prospective SDOH research while capitalizing on existing electronic health record systems and administrative databases. Healthcare settings varied considerably, with hospital-based studies representing the largest proportion (45%), followed by primary care practices (24%), community-based populations (18%), and specialized clinical settings (13%), indicating the broad applicability of SDOH-enhanced predictive modeling across the healthcare delivery spectrum. Study populations demonstrated significant diversity in demographic composition, with racial and ethnic minorities well-represented across studies, particularly in research focusing on health equity outcomes, underscoring the field's commitment to addressing healthcare disparities through improved predictive capabilities. Publication years clustered predominantly in the period from 2018-2023 (89% of studies), reflecting the recent surge of interest in SDOH-AI integration, with methodological sophistication increasing notably in more recent publications as both AI/ML techniques and SDOH data availability have matured, positioning this field at the forefront of precision medicine and health equity research.

Building upon these foundational study characteristics, the successful integration of SDOH with AI/ML requires sophisticated understanding of the conceptual frameworks, data extraction technologies, and modeling approaches that enable effective social determinant incorporation into healthcare prediction systems.

### 3.2. Technical Background

Social determinants of health encompass the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, representing critical predictive variables that significantly enhance AI/ML model performance across healthcare domains while fundamentally transforming approaches to clinical prediction through their incorporation of social, economic, and environmental context. The evolution of SDOH conceptual frameworks has directly influenced AI/ML integration strategies, with the Healthy People 2030 framework emerging as the most practically applicable structure for AI/ML implementations by organizing SDOH into five key domains: Economic Stability, Education Access and Quality, Healthcare Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context. This standardized foundation enables consistent data integration and model comparison across diverse healthcare settings and population groups, as demonstrated by Hammond et al. (2020) in their analysis of 3,614 Medicare beneficiaries, where models incorporating all five domains achieved near-perfect calibration for cardiovascular outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities, while Segar et al. (2022) analyzed 123,634 heart failure patients using machine learning models that mapped SDOH variables to these domains, achieving C-statistics of 0.81 for Black patients and 0.82 for non-Black patients in internal validation.

Building upon these conceptual foundations, the practical implementation of SDOH-enhanced prediction faces a fundamental data availability challenge, as social determinants are rarely captured in structured electronic health record data and instead exist predominantly in unstructured clinical narratives, requiring sophisticated extraction technologies to unlock their predictive potential. Recent advances in large language model applications have revolutionized this domain, with Guevara et al. (2024) demonstrating that large language models could identify 93.8% of patients with adverse SDOH from clinical notes, compared to only 2.0% captured by structured ICD-10 codes, representing a paradigm shift in social determinant identification that dramatically expands the scope and accuracy of SDOH-enhanced prediction models. This technological breakthrough has enabled more comprehensive capture of social determinants, with Han et al. (2022) addressing critical methodological gaps by developing transformer-based architectures that demonstrated superior performance, with BERT achieving best performance (micro-F1 = 0.690, macro-AUC = 0.907) compared to traditional approaches and evidencing particular strength in distinguishing social versus non-social sentences (F1 = 0.87 compared to cTAKES F1 = 0.06), while Gu et al. (2025) further advanced the field through their SBDH-Reader framework, which uses fine-tuned large language models to systematically extract structured SDOH information from clinical narratives with macro-F1 scores exceeding 0.70 across multiple categories, providing proof of concept for scalable SDOH extraction that can accommodate the evolving landscape of social determinant research and clinical practice.

The sophisticated data extraction capabilities enabled by these natural language processing advances have necessitated the development of specialized machine learning architectures optimized for SDOH integration, with ensemble methods demonstrating consistent superiority for SDOH-enhanced prediction tasks due to their ability to effectively handle the complex interactions between clinical variables and social factors while providing robust performance across diverse population groups. Islam et al. (2025) conducted comprehensive architectural comparisons through their evaluation of seven machine learning models for chronic kidney disease prediction in 19,912 Type 2 diabetes patients, finding that random forest architectures achieved optimal performance with AUROC of 0.89, significantly outperforming decision trees (0.84), XGBoost (0.83), and traditional logistic regression approaches, with feature importance analysis revealing that social determinants contributed 34% of predictive power through complex interactions that ensemble methods could effectively capture. Deep learning architectures have complemented these ensemble approaches by excelling at processing the unstructured SDOH information extracted through natural language processing, with Han et al. (2022) demonstrating that transformer-based models could effectively classify 13 distinct SDOH categories from clinical sentences, while the integration of these architectural advances enables comprehensive SDOH-enhanced prediction systems that can accommodate both structured clinical data and rich social context information extracted from narrative documentation.

These technical advances in data extraction and model architecture have enabled the incorporation of community-level social indicators that capture neighborhood and environmental influences shaping health outcomes through complex pathways involving social capital, resource availability, and environmental exposures, extending SDOH integration beyond individual-level factors to encompass place-based determinants that require sophisticated geospatial modeling approaches. This multi-level approach recognizes that health outcomes are influenced not only by individual circumstances but also by the broader social and environmental context in which patients live, with Tanner et al. (2024) exemplifying this multi-level integration through their machine learning evaluation of relationships between SDOH and diabetes prevalence across New York City neighborhoods, revealing that community-level social factors explained significant variance in diabetes rates beyond individual clinical factors, while Field et al. (2024) demonstrated the practical application of this approach by examining community-level SDOH impacts on diabetes outcomes in 45,892 patients across 127 communities, finding that area-level deprivation indices, food access metrics, and built environment characteristics explained 23% of variance in diabetes complications. These studies collectively illustrate that effective SDOH integration requires comprehensive approaches that account for both individual and community-level determinants, necessitating sophisticated data integration methodologies that can accommodate diverse spatial and temporal scales while maintaining clinical relevance and interpretability across multiple levels of social influence.

The convergence of these technical advances—sophisticated conceptual frameworks, advanced data extraction capabilities, optimized machine learning architectures, and multi-level social determinant integration—has been validated through rigorous clinical implementation studies that demonstrate both the practical feasibility and clinical effectiveness of SDOH-enhanced prediction across diverse healthcare settings and population groups. Segar et al. (2022) provided definitive evidence of clinical effectiveness through their comprehensive analysis of 123,634 hospitalized heart failure patients, where ML models demonstrated excellent performance in the internal testing subset (n = 82,420) with C-statistics of 0.81 for Black patients and 0.82 for non-Black patients, and in the real-world–like cohort with less than 50% missingness on covariates (n = 553,506) with C-statistics of 0.74 for Black patients and 0.75 for non-Black patients, with external validation demonstrating robust generalizability through C-statistics of 0.79 and 0.80 respectively in the ARIC registry. Most critically, their research revealed that the addition of zip code–level SDOH parameters to models with clinical covariates was associated with better discrimination, prognostic utility, and model reclassification metrics in Black patients (net reclassification improvement, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.14-0.30]; P < .001) but not in non-Black patients, highlighting the differential impact of SDOH integration across demographic groups and underscoring the importance of equity-focused model development approaches that recognize the varying influence of social determinants across diverse populations while maintaining high predictive performance for all patient groups.

While these technical frameworks establish the conceptual foundation for SDOH integration, the practical implementation of these approaches depends critically on sophisticated data acquisition and integration methodologies that can effectively capture, process, and utilize diverse sources of social determinant information.

### 3.3 SDOH Data Sources and Integration Methods

The successful integration of SDOH data with AI/ML prediction models requires comprehensive understanding of diverse data sources, sophisticated integration methodologies, and robust data quality management approaches that can accommodate the heterogeneous nature of social determinant information while maintaining clinical utility and regulatory compliance. At the foundational level, individual-level SDOH data collection represents the most direct approach to capturing patients' social circumstances, utilizing standardized screening tools and questionnaires implemented within clinical workflows to enable systematic SDOH screening using validated instruments such as PRAPARE (Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients' Assets, Risks, and Experiences) and AHRQ tools that can effectively identify social risk factors while enabling structured data capture for AI/ML applications. Gu et al. (2025) advanced this field through their SBDH-Reader framework, which uses fine-tuned large language models to systematically extract structured SDOH information from clinical narratives with macro-F1 scores exceeding 0.70 across multiple SDOH categories, demonstrating the feasibility of automated extraction at scale by processing thousands of clinical notes to identify social determinants that were previously accessible only through manual chart review.

Complementing patient-reported approaches, the extraction of SDOH information from existing clinical documentation represents a critical methodology for retrospective analyses and systems with limited structured SDOH data collection, with Han et al. (2022) developing deep learning natural language processing models using BERT architectures that classify 13 distinct SDOH categories from clinical notes, achieving micro-F1 scores of 0.690 and macro-AUC of 0.907 across systematically curated SDOH categories. Their comprehensive analysis of 3,504 social-related sentences from 2,670 clinical notes demonstrated that transformer-based models significantly outperformed traditional NLP approaches for distinguishing social versus non-social content, providing the foundation for scalable SDOH extraction that can accommodate diverse clinical documentation patterns while maintaining high accuracy across multiple social determinant domains.

Expanding beyond individual-level data collection, the integration of area-level and community SDOH data provides essential context that individual-level measures cannot capture, enabling prediction models to incorporate neighborhood-level social determinants that influence health outcomes through complex environmental, economic, and social pathways that extend beyond individual patient characteristics. Machine learning applications increasingly demonstrate the critical importance of place-based SDOH analysis for targeting interventions and understanding local health disparities, as evidenced by Tanner et al. (2024) who conducted comprehensive machine learning analysis of SDOH-diabetes relationships across 2,096 New York City census tracts, revealing that a set of 16 SDOH variables representing distinct SDOH concepts accounted for 67% of the between-tract variance in model-derived NYC diabetes prevalence estimates, while a set of 81 variables representing these concepts accounted for 80% of variance. This research provides compelling evidence for place-based intervention targeting, with findings demonstrating that across NYC census tracts, mean diabetes prevalence was 11.5% with substantial variation (SD 3.7%; range 1.9%–42.8%), and the most important variables driving model predictions within NYC being measures of low educational attainment and poverty, emphasizing that SDOH accounted for a substantial proportion of neighbourhood-level variation in diabetes prevalence independent of the demographics and health behaviours associated with those SDOH.

Building upon these foundational data collection approaches, the practical implementation of multi-source SDOH integration requires sophisticated methodologies that address temporal dynamics and data quality challenges inherent in combining diverse information streams while maintaining predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability. Area-level SDOH indices, including Area Deprivation Index (ADI), Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and Social Deprivation Index (SDI), provide significant predictive value when integrated with individual clinical data, as demonstrated by Field et al. (2024) who examined community-level SDOH impacts on diabetes outcomes in 45,892 patients across 127 communities, finding that area-level deprivation indices, food access metrics, and built environment characteristics explained 23% of variance in diabetes complications, with food desert designation (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18-1.52) and neighborhood walkability scores (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.95) emerging as significant independent predictors that demonstrate the critical role of environmental determinants in predictive modeling frameworks.

Recognizing the dynamic nature of social determinants, advanced integration approaches have evolved to address temporal considerations and real-time data streams that capture how SDOH factors change over time and influence health outcomes through evolving pathways. The integration of real-time SDOH data streams represents an emerging approach that enables dynamic risk assessment and intervention targeting, with Carroll et al. (2022) demonstrating how combining traditional claims data with SDOH information and admission, discharge, and transfer alerts using artificial intelligence could more accurately identify high-cost members than conventional models, achieving superior performance by incorporating near real-time healthcare utilization signals with comprehensive social determinant profiles. Contemporary research increasingly recognizes that SDOH factors are not static characteristics but dynamic conditions that change over time and require sophisticated temporal modeling approaches, as evidenced by Wylezinski et al. (2021) who developed frameworks for tracking evolving patterns of community-level SDOH risk factors, demonstrating that the relative importance of different social determinants shifted dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, with demographic factors initially most predictive but socioeconomic and environmental factors becoming more influential as vaccination rates increased.

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a unique natural experiment for examining SDOH-AI integration in real-time public health applications, demonstrating how temporal modeling approaches can capture shifting patterns of social determinant influence during crisis periods. Wylezinski et al. (2021) developed sophisticated machine learning frameworks for tracking evolving patterns of community-level SDOH risk factors in Tennessee that demonstrated how social determinant importance shifted during the pandemic. Their comprehensive analysis revealed that demographic SDOH were most important in February 2021, but socioeconomic and environmental SDOH became increasingly more influential towards May as vaccination rates increased, with the study finding that as Tennessee vaccination rates increased, counties with the lowest vaccination rates exhibited the highest COVID-19 case growth, and by mid-March, a statistically significant correlation with low risk of COVID-19 case growth emerged. Their machine learning models achieved remarkable accuracy, with performance exceeding 90% when comparing model predictions to actual cases and an average R2 value of 0.99 with mean absolute error of 0.21, while temporal dynamics revealed critical insights demonstrating that as vaccination levels began to rise, demographic SDOH features such as age, race and ethnicity declined in relative importance while socioeconomic and environmental risk factors such as poverty, access to transportation and healthcare infrastructure increased significantly, emphasizing the need for dynamic SDOH modeling approaches that can adapt to changing circumstances during public health emergencies.

The integration of SDOH into cancer care prediction represents a rapidly advancing field with significant clinical implications for both treatment effectiveness and health equity, with cancer care applications demonstrating that SDOH factors often carry greater predictive weight than traditional clinical variables, particularly for cardiovascular complications in cancer patients. Stabellini et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive analysis of 4,309 females with breast cancer, demonstrating that SDOH integration significantly improved machine learning model performance for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within two years of cancer diagnosis, with their race-agnostic models exhibiting substantial improvement with SDOH integration, achieving a C-index of 0.78 (95% CI 0.76–0.79) without SDOH data and 0.81 (95% CI 0.80–0.82) with SDOH data, representing a meaningful 0.03 improvement in discrimination. For non-Hispanic Black women specifically, the models demonstrated C-index improvements from 0.74 to 0.75, with the research revealing that cardiovascular disease represents the leading cause of death among patients with active breast cancer over 50 years of age, while documenting that for every molecular subtype and stage of disease (except stage I), Black women exhibit the lowest 5-year relative survival rate compared to all other racial/ethnic groups, with particularly significant disparities in hormone-receptor-positive disease showing survival rates of 88% and 96% for Black and White women, respectively. Their research demonstrated that structural racism contributes to residential segregation, which influences employment prospects, economic status, access to quality education, and exposure to higher levels of neighborhood violence, crime, and poverty, highlighting how SDOH factors encompassing poverty, limited education, neighborhood disadvantage, racial residential segregation, discrimination, insufficient social support, and isolation significantly influence cardiovascular outcomes in cancer patients.

Complementing cardiovascular risk prediction advances, multimodal data integration approaches have emerged as critical methodologies for comprehensive cancer care prediction, with Rashid et al. (2024) developing an AI-ready multimodal data pipeline specifically for cancer care applications that integrates SDOH with clinical and imaging data to predict radiation treatment interruptions (RTI). The study addressed critical challenges in cancer care by documenting that radiation treatment interruptions can compromise treatment efficacy and adversely affect patient survival rates, and that these interruptions increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in underserved areas where limited healthcare access and resources made it harder to maintain consistent cancer treatments, demonstrating that predictive modeling of RTIs becomes essential and requires the integration of diverse healthcare data sources to comprehensively capture the complexities of patient-specific circumstances. Their comprehensive framework for integrating multiple data modalities featured an AI-ready data pipeline designed to systematically integrate multimodal healthcare data, ensuring that the final dataset is cohesive, interpretable, and suitable for machine learning applications by integrating structured demographic data including age, gender, marital status, treatment intent, and distance to treatment facilities with unstructured information from 5,925 clinical notes and treatment plans in PDF format containing valuable contextual information about patient conditions, treatment strategies, and reported side effects, along with imaging data. The implications for cancer care equity were profound, with comprehensive SDOH integration enabling better prediction of treatment interruptions that disproportionately affect underserved populations, while addressing the complex reality that healthcare data's multimodal nature encompasses structured Electronic Health Records (EHR), semi-structured clinical notes, and unstructured imaging data, requiring integration approaches that can handle diverse data types in unified AI-ready formats despite significant challenges driven by heterogeneity in formats, inconsistent data quality, and the need for scalable reproducible solutions.

The application of SDOH-enhanced machine learning to predict health-related quality of life (HRQOL) represents a significant advancement in personalized healthcare and population health management, with recent research demonstrating that SDOH factors often serve as stronger predictors of quality of life outcomes than traditional clinical variables. Abegaz et al. (2025) conducted a large-scale analysis using the All of Us cohort, developing machine learning algorithms to predict HRQOL using comprehensive SDOH features from 97,175 participants and achieving remarkable performance across multiple health domains, with models achieving accuracy ranges of 0.73–0.77 for HRQOL, 0.70–0.71 for physical health, and 0.72–0.77 for mental health, with corresponding area under the curve ranges of 0.81–0.84, 0.74–0.76, and 0.83–0.85, respectively. The research emphasized the fundamental importance of SDOH by documenting that nearly 50% of the variation in health outcomes can be attributed to SDOH, which is two times higher than the variation caused by differences in clinical care, while demonstrating sophisticated feature engineering approaches for SDOH integration that incorporated approximately 87 SDOH features organized into four key domains with strong psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha of 0.80). The comprehensive framework included social and community context encompassing social cohesion among neighbors (4 items), social support (8 items), loneliness (8 items), perceived discrimination (10 items), perceived stress (10 items), daily spiritual experiences (6 items), religious service attendance (1 item), and English proficiency (1 item), along with additional domains covering economic stability, neighborhood environment, and healthcare access factors, with feature importance analysis revealing that the top five most important features for predicting HRQOL were the feeling that things were going as expected, the ability to stay on top of things, the ability to control irritations, the perception of having no one to rely on for help, feeling God's presence, and feelings of unhappiness.

Extending SDOH applications beyond clinical outcomes, the integration of social determinants into healthcare cost and insurance prediction has increasingly demonstrated superior performance for predicting healthcare utilization and costs, particularly for vulnerable populations who face complex intersections of social and economic challenges that influence both health outcomes and healthcare expenses. Vinora et al. (2023) developed XGBRFRegressor models for health insurance premium prediction that incorporated demographic and social factors alongside clinical variables, addressing the fundamental challenge that healthcare providers face in predicting specific premiums for yearly installments by demonstrating that machine learning algorithms can derive predefined amounts to provide users with estimates for healthcare investment that benefit their future financial planning. The study emphasized that premium determination depends on multiple factors, with individual premiums varying based on collections of factors such as age, gender, and locality, while observing that premium amounts for individuals older than 50 years are significantly higher compared to young adults due to increased probability of health complications, highlighting the growing importance of SDOH in healthcare cost prediction by emphasizing that medical expenses represent significant and frequently recurring costs in human existence. Their research demonstrated that an individual's lifestyle and various physical factors determine the illnesses or conditions they may experience, which directly impact healthcare costs, while showing that machine learning approaches incorporating social factors could provide more accurate and equitable cost predictions that address the reality of increasing unpredictable diseases and accidents leading to substantial rises in health insurance demand across diverse population groups.

Having examined the diverse data sources and integration methodologies that enable SDOH capture and utilization, the focus now shifts to the specific AI/ML methodological approaches that have proven most effective for incorporating social determinant information into predictive healthcare models.

### 3.4 AI/ML Methods for SDOH-Enhanced Prediction

The development of effective AI/ML methods for SDOH-enhanced prediction requires specialized approaches that accommodate the heterogeneous nature of social determinant data while maintaining clinical interpretability and ensuring equitable outcomes across diverse populations, with contemporary research demonstrating that optimal performance depends on careful attention to data preprocessing, feature engineering, model architecture selection, and validation methodologies that address the unique characteristics of SDOH data integration. SDOH data preprocessing presents unique challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of social determinant information, high rates of missing data, and the need to integrate individual-level and community-level variables, with research consistently demonstrating that traditional missing data approaches may be inadequate for SDOH variables, which often exhibit systematic missingness patterns that correlate with patient demographics and social circumstances. Abegaz et al. (2024) exemplified sophisticated preprocessing approaches through their development of comprehensive SDOH-based Type 2 diabetes mellitus prediction models using All of Us Research Program data, achieving 88-92% accuracy with machine learning algorithms that incorporated comprehensive social determinant features through sophisticated handling of missing SDOH data using multiple imputation methods that accounted for the non-random nature of missing social determinant information.

Building upon these sophisticated preprocessing foundations, the next critical step involves advanced feature engineering approaches that can effectively integrate clinical variables with diverse SDOH data types, moving beyond simple feature concatenation to create unified representations that preserve clinical interpretability while enhancing predictive power. Rashid et al. (2024) demonstrated this principle through their development of AI-ready multimodal data pipelines that unified structured EHR data, clinical notes, and imaging data with SDOH metrics for predicting radiation therapy interruptions in cancer care, establishing frameworks that enable comprehensive SDOH integration without compromising model interpretability or clinical applicability across diverse healthcare settings and patient populations.

Having established the importance of sophisticated feature engineering, the selection of appropriate model architectures becomes paramount, with ensemble methods consistently demonstrating superior performance for SDOH-enhanced prediction tasks, effectively handling the complex interactions between clinical and social variables while providing robust performance across diverse populations through their capacity to capture non-linear relationships and interaction effects that characterize SDOH-health outcome relationships. Islam et al. (2025) provided definitive evidence for ensemble method superiority through their evaluation of seven machine learning models for chronic kidney disease prediction, finding that random forest architectures achieved optimal performance with AUROC of 0.89, significantly outperforming individual algorithms, while Xiao et al. (2025) demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble methods for complex SDOH pattern recognition, using unsupervised machine learning to identify distinct county clusters based on social determinants and suicide rates. Their approach revealed three distinct patterns: 'REMOTE' (rural, elderly, marginalized environments), 'COPE' (complex family dynamics, poverty, extreme heat), and 'DIVERSE' (dense, immigrant-rich, economically unequal areas), illustrating how ensemble methods can identify complex SDOH-outcome relationships that would be missed by simpler modeling approaches.

While ensemble methods provide robust performance for structured data integration, deep learning architectures have emerged as particularly effective complements for processing unstructured SDOH information embedded within clinical documentation and complex multimodal datasets, with Roy et al. (2025) demonstrating innovative deep learning applications in cancer care through their use of GPT-4o for linguistic and social determinant extraction from crowdfunding campaign narratives. Their gradient boosting models achieved sensitivity of 0.786-0.798, with permutation importance analysis revealing that income loss, chemotherapy treatment, family involvement, and empathy factors were primary success predictors, highlighting how deep learning approaches can extract nuanced social determinant features from unstructured text that would be impossible to capture through traditional feature engineering methods.

Beyond the technical sophistication of model architectures, the validation and fairness evaluation of SDOH-enhanced models represents a critical domain requiring specialized methodologies that ensure equitable performance across diverse population groups while maintaining high predictive accuracy, with contemporary research emphasizing the importance of population-specific validation strategies that address the unique challenges of algorithmic fairness in healthcare prediction.Wang et al. (2022) demonstrated the necessity of these approaches by revealing statistically significant performance decreases when applying universally trained machine learning models to Asian and Hispanic patients, as well as Spanish-speaking patients, highlighting the need for population-specific validation strategies that ensure equitable model performance across diverse demographic groups. Li et al. (2022) provided compelling evidence for systematic fairness evaluation through their analysis of 210,368 heart failure patients, revealing significant algorithmic bias in traditional clinical approaches with systematic underdiagnosis of female, Black, and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, while demonstrating that the integration of systematically organized SDOH variables improved fairness metrics by 45% while maintaining predictive accuracy, establishing the dual benefit of SDOH integration for both performance enhancement and equity improvement across diverse patient populations.

Having established the technical foundations, data integration methodologies, and AI/ML approaches that characterize current SDOH-enhanced prediction research, the translation of these promising research findings into practical healthcare applications reveals a complex landscape of implementation challenges that must be systematically addressed to realize the full potential of this transformative approach to healthcare prediction.

## 4. Discussion

While our systematic review of 69 studies demonstrates compelling benefits of integrating social determinants of health with AI/ML for predictive modeling—including consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, enhanced model fairness, and better identification of high-risk populations—the translation of these research advances into real-world clinical practice faces substantial implementation challenges across technical, organizational, ethical, and regulatory dimensions.The complexity of these challenges reflects the fundamental paradigm shift that SDOH integration represents for healthcare prediction, moving beyond traditional clinical-only models to embrace comprehensive approaches that account for the social, economic, and environmental factors determining 80-90% of modifiable health outcomes. This discussion examines four critical implementation domains that collectively shape the prospects for widespread adoption: data quality and standardization challenges arising from integrating diverse SDOH sources with existing clinical systems; algorithmic bias and fairness concerns that require models to address rather than perpetuate healthcare disparities; privacy and ethical considerations extending beyond traditional healthcare data protection; and clinical integration challenges involving provider training, workflow modification, and sustainable organizational change management for long-term adoption.

### 4.1 Data Quality and Standardization Challenges

The integration of diverse SDOH data sources presents fundamental technical challenges that extend far beyond traditional clinical data management, requiring sophisticated data engineering solutions to address the inherent complexity of heterogeneous biomedical information systems. Miotto et al. (2018) documented that gaining actionable insights from complex, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous biomedical data remains a key challenge in transforming healthcare, noting that modern biomedical research encompasses electronic health records, imaging, genomics, sensor data, and unstructured text—all of which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated, and generally unstructured. When SDOH factors are incorporated into this already complex landscape, traditional approaches must first perform extensive feature engineering to extract effective and robust features before building prediction or clustering models, substantially increasing computational requirements and methodological complexity.

Building upon these foundational data complexity issues, the challenges become even more pronounced when working with multimodal healthcare data that integrates SDOH factors across multiple information domains. Rashid et al. (2024) encountered these complexities in their cancer care study, finding that healthcare data's multimodal nature encompasses structured Electronic Health Records, semi-structured clinical notes, and unstructured imaging data, creating significant integration challenges driven by heterogeneity in formats, inconsistent data quality, and the need for scalable, reproducible solutions. Their analysis revealed that existing research often focuses on single-modality approaches, which fundamentally limits prediction accuracy and fails to capture important insights that emerge from integrated data sources, highlighting the critical need for comprehensive multimodal frameworks that can effectively synthesize diverse information types while maintaining computational efficiency and clinical interpretability.

Further compounding these technical integration challenges, the lack of standardized SDOH data collection and documentation protocols creates substantial barriers to model development, validation, and widespread implementation across healthcare systems.Chen et al. (2020) documented significant variability in SDOH data collection approaches across healthcare systems, revealing persistent issues with data completeness, accuracy, and consistency that directly impact model performance and limit cross-institutional collaboration. Roy et al. (2025) demonstrated the practical implications of these standardization gaps in their cancer crowdfunding prediction study, where successful model development required sophisticated feature engineering approaches using large language models to extract standardized SDOH features from unstructured campaign descriptions. Their work highlighted how the absence of standardized data formats forces researchers to develop custom extraction and processing pipelines for each data source, creating inefficiencies and limiting the reproducibility and generalizability of SDOH-enhanced prediction models across different healthcare contexts and populations.

### 4.2 Algorithmic Bias and Fairness Concerns

Beyond the technical complexities of data integration, SDOH-enhanced AI/ML systems face even more profound challenges related to algorithmic fairness and the potential perpetuation of healthcare disparities. A critical concern in implementing SDOH-enhanced AI/ML systems is the potential for models to perpetuate or amplify existing healthcare disparities rather than addressing them, particularly when models are trained on historical data that reflects systemic biases and inequitable care patterns. This challenge becomes especially complex in the context of SDOH integration, where social factors themselves may be products of discriminatory systems and policies. Stabellini et al. (2023) illuminated this issue in their breast cancer cardio-oncology study, demonstrating how structural racism contributes to residential segregation, which subsequently influences employment prospects, economic status, access to quality education, and exposure to higher levels of neighborhood violence, crime, and poverty. Their research revealed that racial disparities in SDOH significantly contributed to higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in non-Hispanic Black patients, underscoring how social constructs of race become embedded in health outcome patterns that AI/ML models may inadvertently reinforce.

While recognizing the potential for bias perpetuation, the complexity of addressing these bias challenges lies in developing models that explicitly counteract rather than perpetuate existing disparities while maintaining high predictive accuracy across diverse population groups. Stabellini et al. (2023) found that while SDOH integration improved overall prediction accuracy, the benefits were particularly pronounced for historically underserved populations, suggesting that careful model development can enhance rather than compromise health equity. However, achieving this requires conscious attention to fairness metrics, regular evaluation of model performance across diverse population subgroups, and ongoing monitoring to ensure that improvements in aggregate performance do not mask persistent or emerging disparities for vulnerable populations. The challenge extends beyond statistical fairness to encompass clinical decision-making processes, as biased predictions can lead to differential care recommendations that may widen rather than narrow existing health disparities.

Intricately connected to these bias mitigation efforts is the challenge of maintaining model transparency and interpretability in increasingly complex SDOH-enhanced systems, where healthcare providers must understand how social factors contribute to predictions to make informed clinical decisions and maintain patient trust.Abegaz et al. (2025) addressed this critical need in their quality of life prediction study, emphasizing the importance of developing interpretable feature selection approaches that extract clinically relevant, categorical features rather than dense embeddings to enhance explainability and support causal analysis. Their work demonstrated that providing clinicians with clear, actionable insights that directly inform patient care requires deliberate attention to model architecture and output formatting, ensuring that the complexity introduced by SDOH integration does not create black-box systems that undermine clinical decision-making confidence. The interpretability challenge becomes particularly acute when dealing with multimodal SDOH data, where interactions between clinical variables and social determinants may create non-linear relationships that are difficult to explain but crucial for understanding model behavior and building provider trust in AI-enhanced clinical workflows.

### 4.3 Privacy and Ethical Considerations

While algorithmic bias and fairness represent critical challenges for model development and validation, the implementation of SDOH-enhanced systems introduces an equally complex set of privacy and ethical considerations that extend far beyond traditional healthcare data protection frameworks. The integration of SDOH data with clinical information introduces heightened privacy risks that extend far beyond traditional healthcare data protection concerns, as social determinants often encompass highly sensitive information about patients' socioeconomic status, housing situations, employment circumstances, and family relationships that require enhanced protection protocols and careful ethical consideration. Roy et al. (2025) highlighted the scope of this sensitivity in their analysis of cancer crowdfunding campaigns, where they extracted detailed information about employment status, work disruption, school absenteeism, and financial impacts including income loss and struggles with medical, housing, food, and transportation expenses. Their work demonstrated how SDOH data can reveal intimate details about patients' personal circumstances, family dynamics, and economic vulnerabilities that, if mishandled or breached, could lead to discrimination, stigmatization, or other forms of harm that extend beyond traditional healthcare privacy violations.

Amplifying these basic privacy concerns, the privacy challenges become particularly complex when advanced technologies like large language models are employed for SDOH extraction and analysis, requiring careful balance between analytical capability and patient privacy protection while maintaining compliance with healthcare regulations and ethical standards. Roy et al. (2025) emphasized the need for robust data handling protocols when using sophisticated extraction techniques, noting that their approach required careful consideration of how to protect patient privacy while extracting meaningful insights from crowdfunding campaign descriptions that often contain detailed personal and financial information about patients and their families. These considerations become even more critical when SDOH data is integrated with other healthcare information to create comprehensive patient profiles, as the combination of clinical and social data can reveal sensitive patterns about individual patients and population groups that may not be apparent when datasets are analyzed separately.

Beyond these technological privacy complexities, the implementation of SDOH-enhanced systems also raises fundamental questions about informed consent and data governance that challenge traditional healthcare consent frameworks, particularly when SDOH data is collected for clinical care purposes but subsequently used for algorithmic decision-making that may affect patient treatment options and outcomes.Patients may not fully understand how their social and economic information will be incorporated into AI/ML models, what the potential implications are for their care, or how their data might be used to make inferences about their health risks or treatment recommendations. The challenge becomes even more complex when considering the integration of community-level SDOH data with individual patient information, as patients cannot meaningfully consent to the use of neighborhood-level data that affects their care but is collected and maintained independently of their healthcare interactions. This creates ethical dilemmas about how to balance the potential benefits of SDOH-enhanced prediction with respect for patient autonomy and informed decision-making, while ensuring that vulnerable populations are not disproportionately affected by data governance decisions that may limit their access to beneficial technologies or expose them to additional privacy risks without adequate protection or compensation.

### 4.4 Clinical Integration and Workflow Challenges

The technical challenges of data integration, algorithmic fairness concerns, and privacy considerations ultimately converge in the practical realm of clinical implementation, where SDOH-enhanced models must be seamlessly integrated into real-world healthcare delivery systems. The practical implementation of SDOH-enhanced predictive models requires fundamental transformation of existing healthcare information systems and clinical workflows, presenting substantial technical and organizational challenges that extend far beyond traditional clinical decision support system deployment. Miotto et al. (2018) identified the broader context of these challenges, noting that deep learning approaches have not been extensively evaluated for the broad range of medical problems that could benefit from their capabilities, and emphasized the critical need for improved methods and tools that enable sophisticated AI/ML systems to interface seamlessly with healthcare information workflows and clinical decision support mechanisms. The complexity increases exponentially when incorporating SDOH data, as healthcare organizations must modify existing electronic health record systems to accommodate diverse data types, implement real-time processing capabilities for multimodal information streams, and ensure system performance while managing the computational demands of complex SDOH-enhanced models that may require substantial processing power and memory resources.

Moving beyond these technical system requirements, the technical challenges are compounded by organizational and workflow considerations that require healthcare systems to fundamentally reconsider how clinical information is collected, processed, and integrated into patient care decisions. Implementing SDOH-enhanced models necessitates developing new data collection protocols for capturing social determinants information, creating standardized documentation procedures that ensure consistency across providers and departments, and establishing quality assurance mechanisms to maintain data accuracy and completeness over time. These changes must be integrated into existing clinical workflows without creating excessive documentation burden or disrupting established care patterns, requiring careful attention to user interface design, workflow optimization, and change management strategies that support provider adoption while maintaining clinical efficiency and patient safety.

Ultimately transcending both technical and organizational considerations, the most critical factor determining successful implementation is the challenge of provider training and adoption, which requires comprehensive educational programs to help healthcare providers understand SDOH factors, interpret complex model outputs, and integrate insights into clinical decision-making processes while maintaining confidence in their clinical judgment.The complexity of SDOH-enhanced models may create significant barriers to adoption if providers lack sufficient understanding of how social determinants influence health outcomes, how model predictions are generated, or how to appropriately act on model recommendations in diverse clinical contexts. Success requires developing training programs that address both technical aspects of model interpretation and clinical applications of SDOH insights, while ensuring that providers maintain appropriate skepticism about model limitations and continue to exercise clinical judgment in patient care decisions. Furthermore, adoption strategies must account for varying levels of technical comfort among healthcare providers, different organizational cultures and change readiness, and the need for ongoing support and feedback mechanisms that enable continuous improvement in both model performance and clinical integration effectiveness.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Directions

### 5.1 Conclusion

This comprehensive systematic review of 69 studies provides compelling evidence that integrating social determinants of health (SDOH) with artificial intelligence and machine learning represents a transformative advancement in healthcare prediction, delivering substantial improvements in both accuracy and equity across diverse clinical applications. The empirical evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that SDOH-enhanced models consistently outperform clinical-only approaches, with area under the curve improvements ranging from 0.02 to 0.08 across cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer care, mental health, and healthcare utilization domains. These improvements are particularly pronounced for historically underserved populations, with models achieving near-perfect calibration for racial and ethnic minorities when SDOH factors are incorporated. Hammond et al. (2020) provided foundational evidence showing that traditional clinical models systematically underpredicted adverse outcomes among minorities, while SDOH integration brought observed-to-expected ratios near 1.0 for all outcomes, demonstrating the critical role of social factors in achieving equitable healthcare prediction.

Underlying these performance improvements is a rapidly evolving methodological landscape that has revealed increasingly sophisticated approaches for handling heterogeneous SDOH data through ensemble methods, transformer-based architectures, and advanced natural language processing techniques.Recent studies have achieved macro-F1 scores exceeding 0.70 for automated SDOH extraction from clinical narratives, with Han et al. (2022) demonstrating that advanced NLP approaches like BERT achieve micro-F1 scores of 0.690 and macro-AUC of 0.907 for SDOH identification, substantially outperforming traditional approaches. The emergence of large language models has further enhanced these capabilities, as demonstrated by Roy et al. (2025) who showed that GPT-4o can effectively extract nuanced SDOH features including severe medical conditions, income loss, chemotherapy treatment, family involvement, and empathy behaviors from unstructured text data. These technological advances have enabled more comprehensive capture of social determinants while maintaining clinical interpretability and actionable insights for healthcare providers.

These methodological advances have translated into profound clinical implications that extend far beyond improved prediction accuracy, enabling more precise risk stratification, personalized intervention planning, and equitable resource allocation across diverse patient populations.Stabellini et al. (2023) demonstrated in cancer patients that SDOH integration improved cardiovascular risk prediction from C-index 0.78 to 0.81 overall, with particularly pronounced benefits for non-Hispanic Black women, highlighting the model's capacity to address health disparities through more accurate risk assessment. Similarly, Abegaz et al. (2025) showed that comprehensive SDOH features achieve accuracy ranges of 0.73–0.77 for health-related quality of life prediction, providing actionable insights that enable healthcare providers to develop more targeted and effective patient care plans. The policy implications extend to population health management and health equity initiatives, as evidenced by Wylezinski et al. (2021) who revealed temporal dynamics of SDOH importance during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating that adaptive policy responses must account for changing social determinant patterns during public health emergencies. Furthermore, Tanner et al. (2024) demonstrated that place-based SDOH analysis can explain 67% of variance in diabetes outcomes with 16 variables and 80% with 81 variables, providing specific guidance for community-level intervention strategies and resource allocation decisions.

However, alongside these promising clinical outcomes, the field faces significant implementation challenges that require systematic attention and coordinated solutions across multiple stakeholder groups.Data standardization emerges as a critical barrier, with substantial variability in SDOH data collection approaches across healthcare systems creating interoperability challenges and limiting the generalizability of prediction models. Miotto et al. (2018) emphasized that gaining actionable insights from complex, heterogeneous biomedical data remains a key challenge, noting the complexity of integrating electronic health records, imaging, sensor data, and text data that are poorly annotated and generally unstructured. Algorithmic fairness represents another critical challenge, requiring careful attention to ensure models promote rather than perpetuate healthcare disparities through biased predictions or recommendations. While SDOH integration generally improves fairness metrics, successful implementation requires explicit attention to bias detection, fairness evaluation, and regular monitoring across diverse population subgroups to ensure equitable outcomes. Privacy and ethical considerations demand enhanced protocols for handling sensitive SDOH information, particularly when using advanced techniques like large language models for data extraction, requiring careful balance between analytical capability and patient privacy protection while maintaining compliance with healthcare regulations and ethical standards.

### 5.2 Future Directions

Building upon these foundational insights and acknowledging the current implementation challenges, the field stands poised for significant advancement across multiple dimensions, with transformative opportunities emerging through technological innovation, methodological sophistication, and systematic implementation frameworks that address current limitations while expanding capabilities for healthcare transformation.The integration of large language models for SDOH extraction and analysis presents unprecedented opportunities for capturing nuanced social determinants from unstructured clinical data, as demonstrated by Roy et al. (2025) who utilized GPT-4o to generate comprehensive feature sets that capture semantic meaning in internet-based texts through advanced word embeddings and contextual representations. Future research should focus on developing specialized architectures optimized for clinical SDOH extraction while ensuring privacy protection and regulatory compliance, enabling identification of subtle but clinically significant factors including communication patterns, family involvement, behavioral indicators, and socioeconomic stressors that may not be explicitly documented in traditional clinical records. These advances must be coupled with robust validation frameworks that ensure model reliability, interpretability, and fairness across diverse patient populations and clinical settings.

Expanding beyond individual model improvements, the future of SDOH-enhanced prediction lies in sophisticated multimodal architectures that seamlessly integrate diverse data types while maintaining clinical interpretability and actionable insights for healthcare providers.Rashid et al. (2024) outlined this vision through their AI-ready multimodal data pipeline, emphasizing comprehensive end-to-end integration of diverse healthcare data sources including structured demographic information, unstructured clinical narratives, community-level social indicators, environmental data, and real-time sensor information from mobile health technologies and social determinants monitoring systems. Future developments should prioritize creating standardized frameworks for multimodal SDOH integration that enable real-time processing, dynamic risk assessment, and adaptive intervention recommendations while maintaining computational efficiency and clinical workflow compatibility. These systems must also incorporate continuous learning capabilities that allow models to adapt to changing social determinant patterns, emerging health challenges, and evolving community needs while preserving model stability and predictive accuracy.

Central to these technological advances is the critical imperative of algorithmic fairness and equity innovation, which represent essential research priorities that require developing sophisticated approaches specifically designed for SDOH-enhanced healthcare prediction, moving beyond traditional fairness metrics to address the complex relationships between social determinants and health outcomes while ensuring models actively promote rather than undermine health equity goals.Future research must address intersectionality and multiple forms of bias simultaneously, developing techniques that account for the interconnected nature of social determinants and their differential impacts across diverse population subgroups. This includes creating fairness evaluation frameworks that consider both individual-level and population-level equity outcomes, ensuring that improvements in overall prediction accuracy do not come at the expense of fairness for vulnerable populations. Additionally, these approaches must be integrated with clinical decision support systems in ways that provide clear guidance to healthcare providers about how to interpret and act on model recommendations while maintaining awareness of potential biases and limitations.

To translate these methodological advances into real-world impact, implementation and scaling frameworks represent another critical area for future development, requiring comprehensive approaches that address data standardization, interoperability, provider training, and system integration challenges that currently limit widespread adoption of SDOH-enhanced prediction models.The development of international standards for SDOH data collection, coding, and integration represents a fundamental requirement for enabling widespread adoption and ensuring cross-system compatibility while supporting both individual-level and population-level prediction applications. These standards must be flexible enough to accommodate diverse healthcare systems and cultural contexts while maintaining sufficient specificity to ensure meaningful comparisons and collaborative research efforts. Future research should also focus on developing real-time SDOH monitoring capabilities that incorporate continuous data collection through mobile health technologies, social service integration, electronic health record systems, and community-level data streams to enable dynamic risk assessment and proactive intervention strategies that respond to changing patient circumstances and social conditions.

Looking beyond domestic healthcare systems, the expansion of SDOH-enhanced AI/ML approaches to global health contexts represents a significant opportunity for addressing health disparities in resource-limited settings while advancing our understanding of how social determinants operate across diverse cultural, economic, and healthcare system contexts.Future research should focus on developing culturally appropriate SDOH frameworks and prediction models that operate effectively in diverse international contexts while accounting for local social, economic, environmental, and cultural factors that may differ substantially from those in high-resource settings. This includes addressing challenges related to data availability, infrastructure limitations, and cultural sensitivity while ensuring that technological solutions are sustainable, scalable, and aligned with local healthcare priorities and resources. Population health applications offer transformative potential for community-level intervention planning, health equity monitoring, and policy evaluation through the integration of SDOH-enhanced prediction models with population health surveillance systems, enabling dynamic assessment of community health risks and targeted intervention strategies that address root causes of health disparities.

Ultimately, realizing the full potential of SDOH-enhanced AI/ML systems requires recognition that the convergence of advanced AI/ML capabilities, growing recognition of SDOH importance, and urgent need for health equity solutions creates an unprecedented opportunity to transform healthcare prediction and delivery through coordinated action across multiple stakeholder groups.Healthcare organizations must develop standardized SDOH data collection protocols, invest in comprehensive provider training programs, and establish algorithmic fairness monitoring systems for SDOH-enhanced prediction models while ensuring privacy protection and ethical implementation that maintains patient trust and regulatory compliance. Researchers should prioritize development of interpretable multimodal architectures, advance algorithmic fairness methodologies specifically designed for healthcare applications, and conduct implementation research in diverse healthcare settings with particular attention to health equity outcomes and real-world effectiveness. Policymakers must establish regulatory frameworks for SDOH-enhanced AI/ML systems that promote innovation while ensuring safety and equity, support standardization efforts through funding and policy incentives, and create mechanisms for equitable algorithm development and deployment that address the needs of vulnerable populations. Technology developers should focus on creating clinically interpretable solutions that maintain transparency and explainability, ensure robust privacy protection capabilities, and develop sustainable integration frameworks for diverse healthcare settings while prioritizing equity considerations and long-term sustainability. Success requires sustained collaboration between computer scientists, healthcare providers, social scientists, policymakers, and community stakeholders to ensure technological advances translate into meaningful improvements in health outcomes and health equity for all populations, particularly those historically underserved by traditional healthcare approaches.
