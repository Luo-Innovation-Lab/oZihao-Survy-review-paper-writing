# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Context and Background

Social determinants of health (SDOH) encompass the broad spectrum of environmental, societal, and economic factors that shape individual and community health trajectories throughout the lifespan (World Health Organization, 2023). These fundamental non-medical influences profoundly affect health outcomes through multiple mechanisms, including differential exposure to health risks, variable access to preventive services, and uneven distribution of healthcare resources (Marmot, 2005). The literature identifies several interconnected dimensions of SDOH that collectively influence health outcomes across populations. These dimensions encompass economic factors (income, employment stability); educational attainment and literacy; neighborhood characteristics and housing quality; healthcare accessibility and affordability; and social cohesion, support systems, and cultural contexts (Marmot, 2005; McNeill et al., 2023). Research indicates these non-clinical factors collectively influence up to 60-80% of health outcomes—a contribution significantly greater than medical interventions alone (Chen et al., 2020; McNeill et al., 2023).

While recognition of SDOH's importance has grown steadily over decades, efforts to systematically integrate these factors into clinical prediction and decision-making remained limited until recently. Early approaches were constrained by fragmented data collection, insufficient computational methods, and siloed healthcare delivery systems (Gottlieb et al., 2015; DeSalvo et al., 2016).

Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies have transformed healthcare analytics. These approaches represent a significant departure from traditional statistical methods, enabling systems to autonomously identify patterns, adapt to new information, and generate predictive insights without continuous human supervision (Rajkomar et al., 2019; Miotto et al., 2018). Advanced AI techniques such as deep learning and natural language processing now permeate clinical workflows, supporting diagnostic decision-making, treatment optimization, and risk stratification across diverse healthcare contexts (Davenport & Kalakota, 2019).

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite significant technological advances in healthcare AI and growing recognition of SDOH's impact on outcomes, a critical disconnect persists between these domains. Traditional clinical prediction models remain constrained by their limited capacity to incorporate non-clinical factors that profoundly influence health trajectories (Chen et al., 2020). This constraint manifests in multiple challenges:

First, current predictive models demonstrate substantial performance disparities across demographic groups, with systematically lower accuracy for socially disadvantaged populations (Rajkomar et al., 2018). Second, data integration barriers between clinical and social domains limit the comprehensiveness of predictive models, with SDOH information frequently fragmented across disconnected systems (Cantor & Thorpe, 2018). Third, methodological approaches for effectively incorporating social determinants into predictive architectures remain underdeveloped and inconsistently applied (Goldstein et al., 2017). Fourth, ethical concerns regarding algorithmic fairness, privacy, and potential reinforcement of existing inequities raise implementation challenges that require careful consideration (Obermeyer et al., 2019).

The consequences of not addressing these challenges are substantial. Models that fail to account for social determinants risk perpetuating or even amplifying health disparities, directing resources away from populations with the greatest need (Rajkomar et al., 2018). Healthcare systems lose the opportunity to identify high-risk patients whose outcomes might be improved through targeted social interventions. The significant economic burden of health disparities—estimated at $93 billion annually in the U.S. alone—continues to grow, with projections suggesting worldwide costs could reach $47 trillion by 2030 if current trends continue (Hacker, 2024).

## 1.3 Purpose Statement

This comprehensive review addresses this critical gap by systematically examining the integration of social determinants of health with artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches for healthcare prediction. Through systematic search of multiple databases and application of structured inclusion criteria, we identified X studies that met our review parameters. Our purpose is to analyze the current state of SDOH-AI integration across healthcare domains, identifying effective methodological approaches, data sources, and implementation strategies that facilitate the incorporation of social determinants into predictive systems. We evaluate performance improvements achieved through SDOH-enhanced models compared to traditional clinical approaches, with particular attention to generalizability across diverse patient populations—a critical consideration for healthcare equity. Additionally, we develop frameworks for ethical implementation that address algorithmic fairness, privacy considerations, and health equity implications throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.

Our analysis explores four central questions that define the current research landscape: how social determinant data are being integrated with AI/ML predictive models across different healthcare domains and what specific data sources are being utilized; what methodological approaches have been developed for extracting and representing SDOH information in computational systems; how SDOH-enhanced AI/ML models perform compared to traditional clinical models in terms of predictive accuracy, generalizability, and clinical utility; and what ethical, technical, and implementation challenges exist in this field, along with strategies proposed to address them effectively. While our primary focus is on contemporary research and recent innovations, we intentionally incorporate foundational literature that established core principles and approaches in both SDOH and AI/ML domains. This approach recognizes that meaningful progress builds upon earlier contributions while adapting to new technological capabilities and evolving healthcare needs, allowing us to present a comprehensive view of the field's evolution and current state.

## 1.4 Significance and Contributions

The integration of SDOH data with AI/ML approaches offers transformative potential for healthcare. Recent evidence demonstrates that SDOH-enhanced models consistently outperform traditional clinical approaches, with typical AUC improvements of 0.03-0.15 (Segar et al., 2022). These models demonstrate superior generalizability across diverse patient populations, enabling more precise risk stratification and targeted interventions (Abbott et al., 2024; McNeill et al., 2023).

Technical innovations have significantly enhanced the accessibility and utility of SDOH information. Recent advances in large language models have substantially improved the extraction of social determinant information from clinical documentation, though challenges in accuracy and completeness remain (Gu et al., 2025). Multimodal AI architectures show promise in synthesizing diverse data types, creating more comprehensive patient profiles that capture both clinical and social vulnerability factors (Rashid et al., 2024). These technological developments benefit multiple stakeholders—clinicians gain more accurate risk prediction tools, policymakers receive evidence for targeted resource allocation, and researchers identify new intervention opportunities to address health disparities.

This review differentiates itself from previous work through four key contributions. First, we examine both cutting-edge research and seminal works across the SDOH and AI/ML domains, providing a comprehensive analysis that spans foundational concepts through recent methodological innovations. Second, we provide detailed technical analysis of emerging methodological approaches, including large language models, multimodal architectures, and explainable AI techniques. Third, we systematically evaluate performance across diverse populations, focusing on generalizability and equity implications. Fourth, we develop a comprehensive framework for ethical implementation addressing bias, fairness, and equity throughout the AI development lifecycle.
