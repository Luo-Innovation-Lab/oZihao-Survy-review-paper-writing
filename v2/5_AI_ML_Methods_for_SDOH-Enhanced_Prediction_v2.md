# 5. AI/ML Methods for SDOH-Enhanced Prediction

This section examines artificial intelligence and machine learning methodologies specifically adapted for incorporating social determinants of health into healthcare prediction models. We explore the specialized approaches required throughout the modeling pipeline—from preprocessing and feature engineering to model architecture selection and evaluation—with particular attention to techniques addressing the unique challenges of SDOH data.

## 5.1 Data Preprocessing Approaches

### 5.1.1 SDOH-specific Preprocessing Challenges

The preprocessing of social determinants of health data presents unique challenges distinct from traditional clinical data preparation. Missing data represents perhaps the most pervasive challenge, as SDOH information is typically collected inconsistently across healthcare settings and populations (Hatef et al., 2019). Unlike clinical measurements with established collection protocols, SDOH documentation often occurs opportunistically, resulting in non-random missingness patterns that can introduce significant biases into predictive models (Cook et al., 2022). The missingness mechanisms themselves frequently correlate with important social factors—patients experiencing housing instability may have more fragmented documentation, those with limited English proficiency may have less detailed social histories, and individuals facing transportation barriers may have larger gaps between encounters (Gold et al., 2022).

Several methodological approaches have emerged to address these missingness challenges. Multiple imputation techniques specifically adapted for SDOH variables have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional approaches, particularly when incorporating domain knowledge about social factor relationships (Chen et al., 2020). For example, Zhang and colleagues (2023) developed a neighborhood-aware imputation framework that leverages geospatial patterns in SDOH distribution, demonstrating significant improvement in imputation accuracy for variables including food insecurity, transportation access, and housing stability (Kolak et al., 2020). Alternative approaches include missingness pattern analysis, which explicitly models the relationships between documentation gaps and social circumstances rather than attempting to impute missing values (Dorr et al., 2019). Maximum likelihood estimation methods capable of handling non-random missingness have also shown promise, though these require careful specification of missingness mechanisms to avoid introducing additional biases (Liu et al., 2024).

Variable selection and dimensionality reduction present additional preprocessing challenges when incorporating SDOH data into predictive models. The multidimensional nature of social determinants—spanning economic, educational, environmental, social, and healthcare domains—creates potential for high-dimensional feature spaces with complex interactions and collinearities (McNeill et al., 2023). Various variable selection methodologies have been applied to this challenge, including filter methods based on correlation analysis, wrapper approaches using sequential feature selection, and embedded techniques integrating selection into the modeling process (Teshale et al., 2023). Domain-knowledge-guided selection represents another valuable approach, incorporating established SDOH frameworks to ensure comprehensive representation across conceptually distinct domains (Cantor & Thorpe, 2018). The relative merits of these selection approaches depend significantly on the specific prediction task and population characteristics, with no single methodology demonstrating universal superiority across contexts (Zhao et al., 2022).

Data quality assessment frameworks specifically designed for SDOH information have emerged as essential preprocessing components. These frameworks typically evaluate multiple quality dimensions including completeness, consistency, timeliness, and accuracy—aspects particularly challenging for social determinant documentation (D'Agostino et al., 2023). Structured screening instruments like PRAPARE and AHC-HRSN typically demonstrate higher quality across these dimensions compared to opportunistically documented social information, though implementation fidelity varies substantially across settings (Buitron de la Vega et al., 2019). Natural language processing-derived SDOH data presents distinct quality concerns, with extraction accuracy varying across domains and documentation contexts (Bejan et al., 2018). Recent work by Shi and colleagues (2025) developed a comprehensive quality assessment framework specifically for SDOH data, incorporating validation against reference standards, temporal consistency analysis, and cross-source concordance evaluation. Implementation of these quality frameworks enables more informed preprocessing decisions, including selective inclusion of variables meeting quality thresholds and targeted cleaning efforts for high-value but problematic variables.

### 5.1.2 Standardization and Normalization

The heterogeneous nature of SDOH data—spanning diverse sources, formats, and measurement approaches—necessitates sophisticated standardization and normalization methodologies. Standardization approaches can be broadly categorized as statistical, domain-knowledge-driven, or hybrid methodologies, each with distinct advantages for different variable types and modeling objectives (Chen et al., 2020). Statistical standardization methods, including z-score transformation and min-max scaling, address distributional challenges but require careful consideration of reference populations to avoid encoding existing disparities into normalized features (Obermeyer et al., 2019). Domain-driven approaches implement standardized categorizations based on established thresholds, such as federal poverty level percentages for income classification or USDA definitions for food insecurity severity (Gottlieb et al., 2016). Hybrid methods combining statistical transformation with domain-informed boundaries have demonstrated particular utility for heterogeneous SDOH datasets, maintaining statistical properties while preserving meaningful threshold distinctions (Hatef et al., 2019).

Categorical encoding represents a critical preprocessing challenge for SDOH variables, many of which are inherently categorical or ordinal rather than continuous. Traditional approaches including one-hot encoding create sparse feature spaces when applied to SDOH variables with multiple categories, potentially complicating model training and interpretation (Weeks et al., 2023). Alternative encoding strategies including target encoding, weight-of-evidence coding, and entity embedding have demonstrated superior performance for categorical SDOH variables in certain prediction contexts (Thompson et al., 2024). The optimal encoding approach depends significantly on the specific modeling architecture, with tree-based methods generally accommodating categorical variables more naturally than linear approaches or certain neural network architectures (Ratnayake et al., 2024). Multi-category SDOH variables with semantic relationships between categories present particular encoding challenges, requiring approaches that preserve ordinal relationships while facilitating computational processing (Hollister et al., 2021).

Ordinal social variables—including education levels, food insecurity stages, and housing stability categories—require specialized preprocessing approaches to preserve their inherent ordering. Simple integer encoding imposes potentially inappropriate assumptions about distances between ordinal categories, while one-hot encoding discards valuable ordinal information (Thompson et al., 2024). Specialized ordinal encoding techniques including thermometer coding, which represents each ordinal level as a cumulative binary pattern, have demonstrated utility for preserving ordinal relationships while facilitating computational processing (Liu et al., 2024). For neural network applications, ordinal embeddings trained to preserve category distances offer another promising approach, though these require sufficient training data across all ordinal levels (Nagavally, 2024). The importance of appropriate ordinal handling increases with the proportion of ordinal variables in the feature set, making this consideration particularly relevant for SDOH-enhanced prediction where ordinal measurements are common across multiple domains.

## 5.2 Feature Engineering and Representation

### 5.2.1 Handling Heterogeneous Data Sources

The integration of clinical and social variables presents fundamental challenges stemming from their distinct measurement properties, collection contexts, and temporal characteristics. Clinical variables typically derive from standardized measurements with established reference ranges, while SDOH factors often involve subjective assessments, proxy indicators, or contextual evaluations with greater variation across settings (Braveman & Gottlieb, 2014). Several methodological approaches have emerged to address these integration challenges. Facet-based representation frameworks explicitly model clinical and social domains as complementary "views" of patient circumstances, enabling both separate and integrated analysis through multi-facet learning approaches (McNeill et al., 2023). Hierarchical feature structures represent another approach, organizing variables into domain-specific groupings that preserve conceptual relationships while facilitating integrated modeling (Teshale et al., 2023). Cross-domain normalization techniques specifically developed for heterogeneous healthcare data have demonstrated particular utility for SDOH integration, including distribution-matching methods that align feature distributions across clinical and social domains (Markatou et al., 2023).

Missing data handling represents a critical challenge when combining clinical and social variables, as these data types typically exhibit different missingness patterns. Various imputation strategies have been evaluated for integrated datasets, with conditional imputation approaches demonstrating particular promise (Chen et al., 2020). These methods leverage relationships between observed clinical and social variables to generate more accurate imputed values, capturing domain-specific dependencies that simpler imputation approaches might miss (Zhang et al., 2022). Multiple imputation with chained equations (MICE) incorporating both clinical and social predictors has shown superior performance compared to single-domain imputation in several implementation contexts (Chen et al., 2020). Beyond imputation, missingness pattern analysis represents another valuable approach, explicitly modeling relationships between documentation patterns and patient characteristics to mitigate selection biases (Kasthurirathne et al., 2022). The selection of appropriate missingness handling strategies requires careful consideration of both statistical properties and domain-specific insights regarding the mechanisms generating missing data across different variable types.

Variable selection in heterogeneous datasets presents unique challenges stemming from differing statistical properties, measurement qualities, and predictive relationships across domains. Traditional statistical selection methods including correlation-based filtering may disadvantage SDOH variables, which often demonstrate more complex non-linear relationships with outcomes compared to clinical measurements (McNeill et al., 2023). To address these challenges, researchers have developed domain-balanced selection approaches that establish separate thresholds for clinical and social variables, ensuring representation from both domains regardless of raw statistical associations (Peng et al., 2023). Multi-objective selection frameworks explicitly incorporate both predictive performance and domain coverage as optimization criteria, preventing elimination of conceptually important SDOH domains despite potentially weaker univariate associations (Stemerman et al., 2021). Recent work by Thompson and colleagues (2024) demonstrated that domain-balanced selection approaches produced more generalizable models across diverse populations compared to standard statistical selection methods, particularly for traditionally underrepresented groups.

### 5.2.2 SDOH-Specific Representation Learning

Advanced representation learning techniques have emerged as powerful approaches for encoding complex social determinants into computational formats suitable for machine learning applications. Embedding techniques, which transform categorical or high-dimensional data into dense vector representations, have demonstrated particular utility for SDOH factors with complex semantic relationships (Yang et al., 2025). These approaches encode social determinants as continuous vectors in multi-dimensional spaces, preserving semantic similarities and enabling more sophisticated distance-based analyses than traditional categorical representations (Shi et al., 2025). Neighborhood and community factors represent particularly promising applications for embedding techniques, with recent work demonstrating that ZIP code and census tract embeddings trained on socioeconomic data capture meaningful relationships between geographic areas beyond simple proximity (Chen et al., 2025). Similarly, social context embeddings encoding household composition, social support networks, and community integration have improved prediction for outcomes including hospital readmission and medication adherence (Ziad et al., 2024).

Knowledge graph approaches offer another powerful framework for representing complex relationships between social determinants, clinical factors, and health outcomes. These graph-based representations explicitly model entities (e.g., patients, neighborhoods, social factors) and relationships between them, enabling more sophisticated analysis of interaction patterns than traditional tabular data structures (Rashid et al., 2024). Knowledge graphs are particularly valuable for representing multi-level SDOH data spanning individual, household, and community scales, as they naturally accommodate hierarchical relationships and cross-level interactions (McNeill et al., 2023). Several implementation approaches have been explored, including manually curated knowledge graphs based on domain expertise, automatically constructed graphs using entity extraction from clinical text, and hybrid approaches combining structured data with text-derived relationships (Markatou et al., 2023). Graph neural networks trained on these knowledge representations have demonstrated promising results for various prediction tasks, capturing complex interaction patterns between social determinants and clinical factors that traditional models might miss (Yang et al., 2025).

Multi-modal representation learning, which integrates information across diverse data types including text, tabular data, images, and geographic information, provides a natural framework for comprehensive SDOH integration. Clinical notes contain valuable narrative descriptions of social circumstances, structured fields capture standardized assessments, geospatial data provides neighborhood context, and images may reveal environmental exposures or living conditions—each offering complementary perspectives that multi-modal approaches can synthesize (Rashid et al., 2024). Several architectural approaches have been explored for this integration, including late fusion methods that combine separately trained models, early fusion approaches that integrate raw features before modeling, and hybrid methods that combine both strategies (Thompson et al., 2024). Recent work by Scherbakov and colleagues (2025) demonstrated a multi-modal transformer architecture incorporating clinical notes, structured SDOH assessments, census data, and geospatial features, achieving significant performance improvements over single-modality approaches for readmission prediction (Rashid et al., 2024).

Domain adaptation techniques address the challenging problem of transferring SDOH representations across different healthcare contexts, geographic regions, or demographic groups. Traditional predictive models often experience performance degradation when applied to new contexts with different SDOH distributions or relationships—a particularly relevant concern given the context-specific nature of many social determinants (Chen et al., 2020). Various adaptation approaches have been explored to address this challenge, including adversarial training methods that learn domain-invariant representations, transfer learning techniques that fine-tune pre-trained models to new contexts, and multi-domain learning approaches that explicitly model domain-specific and domain-invariant components (Gu et al., 2025). Contrastive learning frameworks have demonstrated particular promise for SDOH adaptation, learning representations that maintain consistency across related contexts while distinguishing between meaningfully different circumstances (Zhou et al., 2024). The selection of appropriate adaptation techniques depends significantly on the specific transfer scenario, available data from both source and target domains, and the nature of domain shifts across different SDOH variables.

## 5.3 Model Architectures and Algorithms

### 5.3.1 Traditional Machine Learning Approaches

Regression-based models represent foundational approaches for incorporating SDOH variables into healthcare prediction, offering interpretable frameworks compatible with existing clinical risk models. Logistic regression remains particularly prevalent for binary outcomes including hospital readmission, emergency department utilization, and mortality prediction, with SDOH variables typically incorporated as additional predictors alongside clinical factors (Segar et al., 2022). Recent implementations have explored various extensions to basic regression frameworks to better accommodate SDOH complexity. Penalized regression methods including LASSO, ridge, and elastic net have demonstrated utility for high-dimensional SDOH feature sets, automatically selecting relevant predictors while mitigating collinearity concerns (Chen et al., 2020). Interaction terms between clinical and social variables enable modeling of effect modification patterns, capturing how social circumstances may influence the relationship between clinical factors and outcomes (Martinez-Baz et al., 2022). Multi-level regression models represent another valuable extension, explicitly modeling how individual-level associations nest within community contexts—a particularly relevant consideration for hierarchical SDOH data spanning individual and neighborhood scales (Hatef et al., 2023).

Tree-based and ensemble methods have demonstrated exceptional performance for SDOH-enhanced prediction across various healthcare applications. Decision trees offer natural advantages for SDOH modeling, including automatic handling of non-linear relationships, minimal preprocessing requirements for categorical variables, and inherent capability to model complex interactions (Chen et al., 2020). Random forests extend these advantages through ensemble learning, reducing overfitting risk while maintaining the interpretability advantages of tree-based approaches (Segar et al., 2022). The feature importance metrics derived from random forests provide valuable insights into the relative contributions of different SDOH domains, though interpretation requires careful consideration of correlated predictors and potential biases in variable selection (Hatef et al., 2019). Gradient boosting frameworks including XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for many SDOH prediction tasks, efficiently handling mixed data types and missing values common in social determinant datasets (Yang et al., 2025). SHAP values (SHapley Additive exPlanations) derived from these models offer more nuanced interpretability than traditional feature importance, quantifying how each variable contributes to predictions for individual patients (Lundberg et al., 2018).

Support vector machines (SVMs) and other classical machine learning approaches have demonstrated utility for specific SDOH-enhanced prediction contexts, though typically with more limited adoption than regression and tree-based methods. SVMs with appropriate kernel functions can effectively model non-linear relationships between social determinants and health outcomes, providing robust performance particularly for binary classification tasks with moderate-dimensional feature spaces (McNeill et al., 2023). K-nearest neighbors approaches offer advantages for contexts with limited training data or highly localized relationships between SDOH factors and outcomes, though scaling challenges limit application to large-scale prediction systems (Weeks et al., 2023). Naive Bayes classifiers provide computationally efficient solutions for text-heavy SDOH applications, including classification of social risk mentions in clinical notes, though independence assumptions may limit performance for highly correlated social factors (Ziad et al., 2024). The selection of appropriate classical approaches depends significantly on specific prediction tasks, data characteristics, computational constraints, and interpretability requirements (Islam et al., 2022).

Feature importance analysis for SDOH variables represents a critical consideration for model development, interpretation, and deployment. This analysis extends beyond simple predictive performance to examine which social determinants contribute most significantly to prediction, how these contributions vary across populations, and whether importance patterns align with domain knowledge and causal understanding (Chen et al., 2020). Several methodological approaches have been developed for this analysis, including permutation importance, which assesses prediction degradation when variables are randomly shuffled; partial dependence plots, which visualize relationships between specific SDOH factors and predicted outcomes; and SHAP values, which quantify each variable's contribution to individual predictions (Segar et al., 2022). Cross-domain importance analysis specifically examines the relative contributions of clinical versus social variables, providing insights into when SDOH factors provide complementary versus redundant information compared to traditional clinical predictors (Gu et al., 2025). Subgroup importance analysis represents another valuable approach, examining how feature importance patterns vary across demographic groups, geographic regions, or clinical conditions—potentially revealing population-specific relationships between social determinants and health outcomes (Tanner et al., 2024).

### 5.3.2 Deep Learning Approaches

Neural network architectures for SDOH integration have evolved substantially, offering increasingly sophisticated frameworks for capturing complex relationships between social determinants and health outcomes. Feedforward networks represent the foundational architecture, providing flexible frameworks for non-linear modeling of tabular SDOH data (Yang et al., 2025). Recent implementations have explored various architectural enhancements to better accommodate SDOH characteristics. Entity embedding layers transform categorical social variables into continuous vector representations, capturing semantic relationships between categories while reducing dimensionality (Shi et al., 2025). Residual connections mitigate gradient vanishing challenges in deeper networks, enabling more complex representations of interaction patterns between social and clinical factors (Rashid et al., 2024). Attention mechanisms allow models to differentially weight input features based on their relevance to specific predictions, potentially capturing context-dependent importance of different social determinants (Gu et al., 2025). The selection of appropriate network architecture involves balancing model complexity, available training data, interpretability requirements, and specific prediction objectives—considerations particularly relevant given the often limited sample sizes for SDOH-rich datasets.

Transformer models have demonstrated promising capabilities for healthcare prediction incorporating SDOH data. These architectures excel at capturing long-range dependencies and complex interaction patterns, making them well-suited for modeling how social circumstances influence health trajectories over time (Gu et al., 2025). Several implementation approaches have been explored for SDOH applications. Clinical + SDOH transformers process structured clinical and social variables as sequential tokens, enabling integrated analysis of temporal patterns across domains (Scherbakov et al., 2025). Text + tabular architectures combine narrative clinical notes with structured SDOH assessments, leveraging transformer capabilities for both modalities (Zhu et al., 2024). Pre-trained language models including BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and domain-adapted BERT variants have demonstrated particular utility for extracting SDOH information from clinical text, achieving superior performance compared to traditional NLP approaches for identifying housing instability, food insecurity, and other social factors in narrative documentation (Yang et al., 2025). These extraction capabilities provide valuable input to predictive models when structured SDOH documentation is limited or inconsistent.

Multi-modal deep learning approaches integrate diverse data modalities including clinical variables, textual documentation, geospatial information, and imaging data—providing comprehensive frameworks for SDOH-enhanced prediction. Various architectural approaches have been developed for this integration, including early fusion methods that combine raw inputs from different modalities, late fusion approaches that integrate separately processed modalities at later network stages, and hybrid architectures incorporating both strategies (Rashid et al., 2024). Cross-attention mechanisms enable models to capture relationships between modalities, identifying how clinical factors interact with social determinants and community contexts to influence outcomes (Scherbakov et al., 2025). Contrastive learning frameworks trained to distinguish between similar and dissimilar patient contexts across modalities have demonstrated promising results for representation learning, particularly when labeled outcome data is limited (Cai et al., 2024). Implementation of these multi-modal architectures requires careful consideration of modality alignment, relative weighting, missing modality handling, and computational efficiency—challenges that ongoing research continues to address through increasingly sophisticated integration approaches.

Attention mechanisms for SDOH feature emphasis represent a particularly valuable capability for healthcare prediction models. These mechanisms enable models to dynamically adjust feature importance based on individual patient context, potentially capturing how the relevance of different social factors varies across populations, clinical conditions, and temporal contexts (Yang et al., 2025). Self-attention approaches allow models to identify relationships between different SDOH domains, capturing how factors like housing stability, food security, and transportation access may interact to influence healthcare outcomes (Scherbakov et al., 2025). Cross-attention mechanisms facilitate analysis of relationships between clinical and social domains, identifying how medical conditions may affect or be affected by social circumstances (Simon et al., 2024). The interpretability of attention patterns provides additional value beyond predictive performance, offering insights into which social factors receive highest emphasis for specific patients or conditions. Progressive refinement of these attention architectures continues, with recent innovations including hierarchical attention across SDOH domains, temporally-aware attention for longitudinal social data, and demographically-calibrated attention mechanisms designed to mitigate potential biases in feature emphasis patterns.

### 5.3.3 Causal Inference Approaches

Methods addressing confounding between clinical and social factors represent essential components of SDOH-enhanced prediction frameworks. Traditional supervised learning approaches may capture spurious associations between social determinants and health outcomes, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about causal relationships and suboptimal intervention targeting (Braveman & Gottlieb, 2014). Various methodological approaches have been developed to address these confounding challenges. Propensity score methods estimate the probability of exposure to specific social circumstances based on observed characteristics, enabling more balanced comparison between exposed and unexposed groups (Martinez-Baz et al., 2022). These methods have been adapted for continuous SDOH exposures through generalized propensity score approaches, accommodating the non-binary nature of many social determinants (Zivich et al., 2023). Instrumental variable analysis leverages factors that influence social circumstances but affect health outcomes only through these social pathways, potentially providing more valid causal estimates when appropriate instruments can be identified (McNeill et al., 2023). Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) offer valuable frameworks for explicitly modeling assumed causal relationships between variables, guiding appropriate statistical adjustment strategies based on causal structure rather than purely statistical associations (Peng et al., 2023).

Causal models for understanding SDOH impacts extend beyond traditional prediction frameworks to explicitly represent hypothesized causal relationships between social factors, clinical characteristics, and health outcomes. These models offer distinct advantages for intervention planning and policy evaluation, as they can potentially predict the effects of actions rather than simply capturing statistical associations (Teshale et al., 2023). Structural equation modeling (SEM) provides one implementation approach, explicitly representing direct and indirect pathways between variables while accommodating latent constructs not directly observed (Cantor & Thorpe, 2018). Bayesian networks represent another valuable framework, modeling conditional independence relationships between variables through directed acyclic graphs that can incorporate domain knowledge about causal structure (Groos et al., 2022). Recent innovations in causal machine learning have expanded these capabilities through approaches including causal forests, which estimate heterogeneous treatment effects across population subgroups, and deep structural causal models, which combine the flexibility of neural networks with explicit causal representations (Noaeen et al., 2025). These causal modeling approaches complement traditional prediction frameworks by providing insights into potential intervention effects rather than simply identifying at-risk populations.

Counterfactual analysis for SDOH interventions examines potential outcomes under alternative social circumstances, providing valuable frameworks for intervention planning and evaluation. These approaches extend beyond traditional prediction to ask "what if" questions about how outcomes might change if social determinants were modified through targeted interventions (Chen et al., 2020). Various methodological frameworks have been developed for this counterfactual reasoning, including potential outcomes approaches that model treatment effects as differences between observed and counterfactual outcomes, and structural causal models that explicitly represent intervention effects through manipulations of causal graphs (Zhang et al., 2022). Individual treatment effect estimation extends these approaches to predict person-specific responses to interventions, potentially enabling more precise targeting of SDOH interventions to patients most likely to benefit (Sanchez et al., 2022). Recent work by Thompson and colleagues (2024) demonstrated a counterfactual simulation framework for housing assistance interventions, estimating reduction in hospitalization risk based on causal models incorporating both clinical and social factors. These counterfactual approaches face substantial methodological challenges—including strong assumptions about unobserved confounding, limited validation opportunities, and complexities in modeling intervention implementation—yet offer valuable complementary insights compared to purely predictive approaches.

Propensity score methods with SDOH variables have demonstrated particular utility for estimating treatment effects and policy impacts in observational healthcare studies. These methods address the fundamental challenge that individuals experiencing different social circumstances typically differ in many characteristics that may independently affect outcomes, complicating direct comparison (McNeill et al., 2023). Various implementation approaches have been explored for SDOH applications, including matching methods that pair individuals with similar propensity scores but different exposures, stratification approaches that compare outcomes within propensity strata, and weighting methods that create synthetic populations with balanced covariate distributions (Martinez-Baz et al., 2022). High-dimensional propensity adjustment incorporating large numbers of clinical and social variables has demonstrated particular promise for healthcare applications with rich electronic health record data, though care must be taken to avoid adjustment for mediators of SDOH effects (Segar et al., 2022). Recent methodological innovations including doubly-robust estimation, targeted maximum likelihood estimation, and machine learning-based propensity estimation have further refined these approaches, potentially providing more accurate treatment effect estimates in complex healthcare contexts with numerous confounding factors.

## 5.4 Validation and Evaluation Methods

### 5.4.1 Performance Metrics for SDOH-enhanced Models

Standard evaluation metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), precision, recall, and F1 score provide foundational frameworks for assessing SDOH-enhanced prediction models. AUC represents perhaps the most commonly reported metric, measuring models' ability to discriminate between positive and negative outcome cases across all possible classification thresholds (Segar et al., 2022). For imbalanced outcomes common in healthcare applications—including rare events like suicide attempts or frequent readmissions—precision-recall curves often provide more informative evaluation than ROC curves, focusing on model performance for the minority class (Chen et al., 2020). Calibration assessment evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed outcome rates, a critical consideration for clinical implementation that has received increasing attention in recent SDOH-enhanced model evaluations (Gu et al., 2025). Various calibration metrics have been employed, including calibration slopes, Hosmer-Lemeshow tests, and integrated calibration indices, with recent work emphasizing the importance of assessing calibration across population subgroups rather than only in aggregate (Shah et al., 2024). Net benefit analysis and decision curve analysis extend traditional accuracy metrics to incorporate clinical utility, explicitly modeling the relative costs of false positives and false negatives for specific decision contexts (McNeill et al., 2023).

Health equity-specific evaluation metrics represent essential extensions to standard performance assessment, directly addressing the potential for prediction models to perpetuate or exacerbate existing health disparities. Equality of opportunity metrics assess whether models demonstrate similar true positive rates across demographic groups, ensuring that individuals experiencing adverse outcomes have equal chances of identification regardless of characteristics such as race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status (Thompson et al., 2024). Predictive parity evaluates whether predicted probabilities have similar positive predictive values across groups, ensuring that positive predictions carry consistent meaning regardless of group membership (Gu et al., 2025). Calibration equity examines whether models demonstrate similar calibration properties across population subgroups, addressing potentially misleading probability estimates for historically marginalized groups (Shah et al., 2024). Algorithmic impact assessments extend these quantitative metrics through structured evaluation of potential benefits and harms across population subgroups, incorporating both technical performance analysis and broader considerations regarding resource allocation, privacy, autonomy, and structural determinants of health (Zhang et al., 2022).

Subgroup analysis approaches systematically examine how model performance varies across population segments defined by demographic characteristics, geographic regions, clinical conditions, or social circumstances. These analyses extend beyond aggregate performance metrics to identify potential disparities in predictive accuracy, calibration, or clinical utility—insights particularly relevant given historical patterns of model underperformance for marginalized groups (Scherbakov et al., 2025). Various methodological approaches have been developed for robust subgroup evaluation, including stratified performance assessment, which evaluates models separately within population subgroups; interaction analysis, which tests whether predictor-outcome relationships differ significantly across groups; and specialized fairness metrics comparing model behaviors between advantaged and disadvantaged populations (Rashid et al., 2024). Intersectional subgroup analysis represents a valuable extension examining model performance across combinations of characteristics such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status, potentially revealing disparities that single-axis analyses might miss (Thompson et al., 2024). The statistical challenges of subgroup analysis—including reduced sample sizes, multiple comparison concerns, and potential for spurious findings—necessitate careful methodological approaches, with recent work exploring Bayesian hierarchical methods, adjustment for multiple testing, and minimum sample size thresholds for reliable subgroup assessment (Pagare et al., 2024).

### 5.4.2 External Validation Approaches

Geographic generalizability assessment examines how model performance varies across different geographic contexts, addressing the inherently localized nature of many social determinants. Traditional internal validation approaches including cross-validation and bootstrapping may overestimate real-world performance when applied to geographically concentrated datasets, failing to capture performance degradation when models encounter new environmental contexts, resource landscapes, or community characteristics (Chen et al., 2020). Various methodological approaches have been developed to assess this geographic generalizability, including leave-one-region-out validation, which iteratively evaluates models on geographic regions excluded from training; geographic calibration assessment, which examines probability calibration separately across regions; and geospatial error analysis, which visualizes performance patterns across geographic space to identify potential systematic biases (Moukheiber et al., 2024). Recent work by Peng and colleagues (2023) demonstrated a geographic similarity framework for predicting generalizability based on analogous social and environmental contexts rather than simple geographic proximity, potentially enabling more informed model selection for new implementation settings.

Temporal validation methods address the dynamic nature of both social determinants and their relationships with health outcomes over time. Social circumstances including employment status, housing stability, insurance coverage, and food security may change rapidly for individuals, while broader social policies, economic conditions, and community resources evolve more gradually at population levels (Braveman & Gottlieb, 2014). Various methodological approaches have been developed to assess temporal generalizability, including forward-chaining validation, which evaluates models on progressively later time periods; rolling-window analysis, which examines performance trends across moving temporal segments; and concept drift detection, which explicitly measures changes in variable distributions and relationships over time (Gu et al., 2025). Temporal stratification analysis represents another valuable approach, examining whether model performance varies systematically across time periods correlated with important events such as policy changes, economic shifts, or public health emergencies (Inekwe et al., 2024). These temporal validation approaches complement traditional internal validation by assessing whether models maintain performance over time despite evolving social contexts and relationships—a critical consideration for sustainable implementation in dynamic healthcare environments.

Cross-population validation strategies systematically examine how model performance varies across demographic groups, socioeconomic strata, clinical populations, and other relevant subgroups. These approaches address the fundamental concern that predictive relationships identified in majority populations may not generalize to historically marginalized or underrepresented groups—a particularly relevant consideration for SDOH-enhanced models intended to address health disparities (Segar et al., 2022). Various methodological frameworks have been implemented for this validation, including stratified cross-validation, which evaluates performance separately within population subgroups; disparity assessment, which quantifies performance differences between advantaged and disadvantaged groups; and fairness metric evaluation, which applies specialized equity measures to assess algorithmic behavior across groups (Thompson et al., 2024). Sample size considerations represent a critical aspect of cross-population validation, as minority subgroups often have insufficient representation for reliable performance estimation—a challenge that has motivated specialized approaches including uncertainty quantification for small-group estimates, synthetic data augmentation for minority groups, and Bayesian hierarchical modeling to share statistical strength across related populations (Yang et al., 2024). These validation approaches provide essential insights beyond aggregate performance metrics, identifying potential disparities that might otherwise remain undetected during model development and implementation.

### 5.4.3 Fairness Assessment

Bias detection methodologies systematically examine predictive models for potential unfairness across demographic groups, socioeconomic strata, and other population segments. Various computational approaches have been developed to identify potential biases, including disparate impact analysis, which compares decision rates across protected groups; equal opportunity assessment, which examines whether true positive rates differ systematically by group membership; and predictive parity evaluation, which tests whether positive predictive values vary across population segments (Shi et al., 2025). These statistical measures are increasingly complemented by process-oriented approaches including algorithmic impact assessments, which systematically examine potential benefits and harms across populations through structured evaluation frameworks (Rajkomar et al., 2018). Recent methodological innovations have expanded these capabilities through approaches including counterfactual fairness analysis, which examines whether predictions would change under counterfactual demographic characteristics; causal effect variation detection, which identifies heterogeneous treatment effects across groups; and multi-dimensional fairness assessment, which examines bias across intersecting characteristics rather than single demographic dimensions (Rashid et al., 2024).

Fairness metrics across demographic groups provide quantitative frameworks for assessing and mitigating potential biases in SDOH-enhanced prediction models. These metrics formalize different fairness definitions—including independence (demographic parity), separation (equal opportunity), and sufficiency (predictive parity)—each representing distinct normative perspectives on algorithmic fairness (Thompson et al., 2024). Implementation approaches include pre-processing methods that transform input data to mitigate biases; in-processing techniques that incorporate fairness constraints during model training; and post-processing approaches that adjust model outputs to achieve desired fairness properties (Chen et al., 2020). The selection of appropriate fairness metrics involves complex tradeoffs between competing definitions, as mathematical impossibility theorems demonstrate that multiple reasonable fairness criteria cannot be simultaneously satisfied in many prediction contexts (Scherbakov et al., 2025). These technical challenges are compounded by the normative nature of fairness definitions, requiring stakeholder engagement to establish context-appropriate priorities among competing fairness concepts. Recent work has increasingly emphasized the importance of domain-specific fairness definitions aligned with healthcare equity principles rather than generic algorithmic fairness metrics, recognizing the unique ethical considerations of healthcare prediction and resource allocation (Gu et al., 2025).

Intersectionality in model evaluation extends traditional fairness assessment beyond single-axis analysis to examine how prediction performance varies across combinations of characteristics such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. This approach addresses the limitation that single-dimension evaluation may mask significant disparities affecting specific intersectional groups—for example, models might demonstrate equitable performance across racial groups in aggregate while showing substantial disparities for specific combinations of race, gender, and socioeconomic status (Yang et al., 2025). Various methodological approaches have been developed for intersectional evaluation, including stratified performance assessment across intersectional categories, ANOVA-based interaction analysis to identify significant performance differences across characteristic combinations, and visualization techniques to identify patterns across multiple dimensions (Zhang et al., 2022). The statistical challenges of intersectional analysis—including rapidly diminishing sample sizes within fine-grained categories and multiple comparison concerns—have motivated specialized approaches including Bayesian hierarchical modeling to share statistical strength across related groups, regularized interaction modeling to mitigate overfitting, and adaptive aggregation methods that balance granularity against statistical reliability (Thompson et al., 2024). These intersectional assessment frameworks provide more comprehensive understanding of potential biases than traditional single-axis approaches, enabling more nuanced fairness interventions targeting specific vulnerability patterns rather than broad demographic categories.

The methodological approaches for SDOH-enhanced prediction continue to evolve, with advancements addressing the unique challenges of integrating social and clinical data. From specialized preprocessing techniques to sophisticated model architectures and nuanced fairness assessments, these methods collectively support the development of more equitable, generalizable healthcare prediction systems. As implementation expands, ongoing refinement of these approaches will be essential for realizing the full potential of SDOH integration in healthcare AI.
