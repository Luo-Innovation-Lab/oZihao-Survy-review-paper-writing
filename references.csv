The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare,"Davenport T, Kalakota R","This paper examines the current state and potential future applications of AI in healthcare, highlighting the shift from early rule-based systems to modern machine learning approaches.","Recent years have witnessed the profound integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across healthcare domains, from diagnostic assistance to treatment optimization and clinical prediction.","Davenport T, Kalakota R. The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare. Future Healthc J. 2019;6(2):94-98.",10.7861/futurehosp.6-2-94,Royal College of Physicians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616181/,"The complexity and rise of data in healthcare means that artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be applied within the field. Several types of AI are already being employed by payers and providers of care, and life sciences companies. The key categories of applications involve diagnosis and treatment recommendations, patient engagement and adherence, and administrative activities. Although there are many instances in which AI can perform healthcare tasks as well or better than humans, implementation factors will prevent large-scale automation of healthcare professional jobs for a considerable period. Ethical issues in the application of AI to healthcare are also discussed."

Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain. Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists. We discuss such challenges and suggest developing holistic and meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge deep learning models and human interpretability."
Clinical applications of natural language processing for clinical decision support,"Wang Y, Wang L, Rastegar-Mojarad M, Liu S, Shen F, Liu H","This study details the application of NLP techniques to extract clinically relevant information from unstructured medical text, demonstrating improvements in information extraction efficiency and accuracy.","Natural Language Processing (NLP), a specialized branch of AI focused on human language interpretation, has emerged as a particularly valuable capability for healthcare systems, enabling automated extraction of clinically relevant information from unstructured documentation.","Wang Y, Wang L, Rastegar-Mojarad M, et al.

In this literature review, we present a review of recent published research on clinical information extraction (IE) applications. A literature search was conducted for articles published from January 2009 to September 2016 based on Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and ACM Digital Library. A total of 1917 publications were identified for title and abstract screening. Of these publications, 263 articles were selected and discussed in this review in terms of publication venues and data sources, clinical IE tools, methods, and applications in the areas of disease- and drug-related studies, and clinical workflow optimizations. Clinical IE has been used for a wide range of applications, however, there is a considerable gap between clinical studies using EHR data and studies using clinical IE. This study enabled us to gain a more concrete understanding of the gap and to provide potential solutions to bridge this gap."
A systematic review of social determinants of health in electronic health records and their impact on analysis and risk prediction,"Chen M, Tan X, Padman R",This systematic review examines how social determinants of health are represented in electronic health records and evaluates their impact on healthcare analytics and risk prediction models.,Traditional clinical prediction models have been constrained by their limited capacity to incorporate non-clinical factors that profoundly influence health outcomes.,"Chen M, Tan X, Padman R.

In accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we conducted a literature search in the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases for English language studies published until March 2020 that examined SDoH domains in the context of EHRs. Our search strategy identified 71 unique studies that are directly related to the research questions. 75% of the included studies were published since 2017, and 68% were U.S.-based. 79% of the reviewed articles integrated SDoH information from external data sources into EHRs, and the rest of them extracted SDoH information from unstructured clinical notes in the EHRs. We found that all but 1 study using external area-level SDoH data reported minimum contribution to performance improvement in the predictive models. In contrast, studies that incorporated individual-level SDoH data reported improved predictive performance of various outcomes such as service referrals, medication adherence, and risk of 30-day readmission. We also found little consensus on the SDoH measures used in the literature and current screening tools. The literature provides early and rapidly growing evidence that integrating individual-level SDoH into EHRs can assist in risk assessment and predicting healthcare utilization and health outcomes, which further motivates efforts to collect and standardize patient-level SDoH information."
About Social Determinants of Health (SDOH),World Health Organization,"The WHO provides a comprehensive definition and framework for understanding social determinants of health, emphasizing their importance in addressing health inequities globally.","Social determinants of health encompass the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, including factors such as economic stability, educational access, physical environment, social context, and healthcare accessibility.","World Health Organization. Social determinants of health. Published 2023. Accessed May 1, 2025.",N/A,World Health Organization,https://www.who.int/health-topics/social-determinants-of-health,"The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age, and the wider forces that shape the conditions of daily life. Most of our health is determined by these non-medical root causes of ill health, which include quality education, access to nutritious food, and decent housing and working conditions. Wider forces include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems. Social determinants of health matter because addressing them not only helps prevents illness but also promotes healthy lives and equity. Health follows a social gradient whereby the more deprived the area in which people live, the lower their income, the fewer their years of education, the worse their health and the fewer healthy years they can expect to live. Governance processes need to ensure that policies and systems are developed and implemented to ensure everyone can realize the conditions needed for a healthy and decent life."
Social determinants of health inequalities,Marmot M,This foundational paper examines the causal pathways through which social factors influence health outcomes and create health disparities across populations.,"These factors exert profound influence on health outcomes through multiple mechanisms, including differential exposure to health risks, variable access to preventive services, disparate treatment efficacy, and uneven distribution of healthcare resources.",Marmot M.

That there should be a spread of life expectancy of 48 years among countries and 20 years or more within countries is not inevitable. A burgeoning volume of research identifies social factors at the root of much of these inequalities in health. Social determinants are relevant to communicable and non-communicable disease alike. Health status, therefore, should be of concern to policy makers in every sector, not solely those involved in health policy. As a response to this global challenge, WHO is launching a Commission on Social Determinants of Health, which will review the evidence, raise societal debate, and recommend policies with the goal of improving health of the world's most vulnerable people. A major thrust of the Commission is turning public-health knowledge into political action."

Greater integration of health and social care could improve referral systems, stimulate innovations in care delivery, and ultimately lead to better patient outcomes. Innovations that make the collection and presentation of social data in EHRs more accurate and efficient—and increasingly standardized—are needed. Without adequately addressing socioeconomic, environmental, and psychosocial factors, new care models aimed at improving population health will lose potential effectiveness. The social history in medicine must be updated for the 21st century to reflect growing evidence on the contribution of social factors to health outcomes."

While medical notes contain rich SBDH details, these are unstructured and conventional extraction methods tend to be labor intensive, inaccurate, and/or unscalable. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to develop more effective approaches for extracting SBDH data. Materials and Methods: We developed the SBDH-Reader, an LLM-powered method to extract structured SBDH data from full-length medical notes through prompt engineering. Six SBDH categories were queried including: employment, housing, marital relationship, and substance use including alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. The development dataset included 7,225 notes from 6,382 patients in the MIMIC-III database. The method was then independently tested on 971 notes from 437 patients at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). We evaluated SBDH-Reader's performance using precision, recall, F1, and confusion matrix. Results: When tested on the UTSW validation set, the GPT-4o-based SBDH-Reader achieved a macro-average F1 ranging from 0.85 to 0.98 across six SBDH categories. For clinically relevant adverse attributes, F1 ranged from 0.94 (employment) to 0.99 (tobacco use). When extracting any adverse attributes across all SBDH categories, the SBDH-Reader achieved an F1 of 0.96, recall of 0.97, and precision of 0.96 in this independent validation set. Conclusion: A general-purpose LLM can accurately extract structured SBDH data through effective prompt engineering. The SBDH-Reader has the potential to serve as a scalable and effective method for collecting real-time, patient-level SBDH data to support clinical research and care."

Objective: This review aims to summarize the use of NLP in mental health research, with a special focus on the types of text datasets and the use of social determinants of health (SDOH) in NLP projects related to mental health. Methods: The search was conducted in September 2024 using a broad search strategy in PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL Complete. All citations were uploaded to Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation) software. The screening and extraction process took place in Covidence with the help of a custom large language model (LLM) module developed by our team. This LLM module was calibrated and tuned to automate many aspects of the review process. Results: The screening process, assisted by the custom LLM, led to the inclusion of 1768 studies in the final review. Most of the reviewed studies (n=665, 42.8%) used clinical data as their primary text dataset, followed by social media datasets (n=523, 33.7%). The United States contributed the highest number of studies (n=568, 36.6%), with depression (n=438, 28.2%) and suicide (n=240, 15.5%) being the most frequently investigated mental health issues. Traditional demographic variables, such as age (n=877, 56.5%) and gender (n=760, 49%), were commonly extracted, while SDOH factors were less frequently reported, with urban or rural status being the most used (n=19, 1.2%). Over half of the citations (n=826, 53.2%) did not provide clear information on dataset accessibility, although a sizable number of studies (n=304, 19.6%) made their datasets publicly available. Conclusions: This scoping review underscores the significant role of clinical notes and social media in NLP-based mental health research. Despite the clear relevance of SDOH to mental health, their underutilization presents a gap in current research. This review can be a starting point for researchers looking for an overview of mental health projects using text data. Shared datasets could be used to place more emphasis on SDOH in future studies."

The association between income and life expectancy in the United States, 2001-2014. JAMA. 2016;315(16):1750-1766.",10.1001/jama.2016.4226,American Medical Association,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2513561,"Importance: The relationship between income and life expectancy is well established but remains poorly understood. Objectives: To measure the level, time trend, and geographic variability in the association between income and life expectancy and to identify factors related to small area variation. Design and Setting: Income data for the US population were obtained from 1.4 billion deidentified tax records between 1999 and 2014. Mortality data were obtained from Social Security Administration death records. These data were used to estimate race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy at 40 years of age by household income percentile, sex, and geographic area, and to evaluate factors associated with differences in life expectancy. Exposure: Pretax household earnings as a measure of income. Main Outcomes and Measures: Relationship between income and life expectancy; trends in life expectancy by income group; geographic variation in life expectancy levels and trends by income group; and factors associated with differences in life expectancy across areas. Results: The sample consisted of 1,408,287,218 person-year observations for individuals aged 40 to 76 years (mean age, 53.0 years; median household earnings among working individuals, $61,175 per year). There were 4,114,380 deaths among men (mortality rate, 596.3 per 100,000) and 2,694,808 deaths among women (mortality rate, 375.1 per 100,000). The analysis yielded 4 results. First, higher income was associated with greater longevity throughout the income distribution. The gap in life expectancy between the richest 1% and poorest 1% of individuals was 14.6 years (95% CI, 14.4 to 14.8 years) for men and 10.1 years (95% CI, 9.9 to 10.3 years) for women. Second, inequality in life expectancy increased over time. Between 2001 and 2014, life expectancy increased by 2.34 years for men and 2.91 years for women in the top 5% of the income distribution, but by only 0.32 years for men and 0.04 years for women in the bottom 5% (P < .001 for the differences for both sexes). Third, life expectancy for low-income individuals varied substantially across local areas. In the bottom income quartile, life expectancy differed by approximately 4.5 years between areas with the highest and lowest longevity. Changes in life expectancy between 2001 and 2014 ranged from gains of more than 4 years to losses of more than 2 years across areas. Fourth, geographic differences in life expectancy for individuals in the lowest income quartile were significantly correlated with health behaviors such as smoking (r = −0.69, P < .001), but were not significantly correlated with access to medical care, physical environmental factors, income inequality, or labor market conditions. Life expectancy for low-income individuals was positively correlated with the local area fraction of immigrants (r = 0.72, P < .001), fraction of college graduates (r = 0.42, P < .001), and government expenditures (r = 0.57, P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In the United States between 2001 and 2014, higher income was associated with greater longevity, and differences in life expectancy across income groups increased over time. However, the association between life expectancy and income varied substantially across areas; differences in longevity across income groups decreased in some areas and increased in others. The differences in life expectancy were correlated with health behaviors and local area characteristics."

A transition between infectious and non-communicable diseases occurred in the early 1900s as a result of improved public health and has persisted ever since. Now, as individuals live longer, the prevalence and cost of chronic disease continue to grow. The estimated cost of chronic disease is expected to reach $47 trillion worldwide by 2030. Individual lifestyle and behaviors and community factors play important roles in the development and management of chronic diseases. Many of these conditions (diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory diseases) are preventable, and their leading risk factors are physical inactivity, poor nutrition, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol. Unfortunately, the investment in prevention remains small compared with treatment, both from a lifestyle perspective and a social determinants of health perspective. Given the future trajectory of chronic disease, innovation in technology and pharmaceuticals with a concomitant investment in prevention will be required. Our future depends on it."

Digital interventions delivered via mobile apps offer a promising approach to increase access to evidence-based mental health interventions for children with ASD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the perspectives of children with ASD toward a mobile health (mHealth) app that integrates evidence-based strategies to help them cope with anxiety. METHODS: We conducted six participatory design sessions with 20 children with ASD, aged 13 to 17 years, to inform the design and development of Exposure Anxiety Manager, a mobile app to help overcome anxiety symptoms through gradual exposure to anxiety-inducing situations. Participatory design involved engaging users with design materials including sketches and wireframes to elicit feedback. Sessions were conducted at a residential summer camp for children with ASD. Sessions were audio recorded, and transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 5 major themes emerged as important considerations for designing a mobile app for children with ASD: (1) social identity, including using avatars for self-representation; (2) gaming elements, including unlocking special features, point systems, and reward incentives; (3) customization, including personalization options for the app's look, feel, and functionality; (4) social motivations, including opportunities to connect socially with peers in person or online; and (5) emotional understanding, including identifying feelings and coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: These five themes represent features that may increase engagement and continued use of a mobile app for managing anxiety among children with ASD. These findings provide insights for the design and development of future mHealth interventions targeting anxiety and other mental health concerns among children with ASD."

It outlines historical and contemporary evidence of inequalities in pandemics—drawing on international research into the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918, the H1N1 outbreak of 2009 and the emerging international estimates of socio-economic, ethnic and geographical inequalities in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. It then examines how these inequalities in COVID-19 are related to existing inequalities in chronic diseases and the social determinants of health, arguing that we are experiencing a syndemic pandemic. It then explores the potential consequences for health inequalities of the lockdown measures implemented internationally as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the likely unequal impacts of the economic crisis. The essay concludes by reflecting on the longer-term public health policy responses needed to ensure that the COVID-19 pandemic does not increase health inequalities for future generations."

Methods and Results: After removing duplicate citations, the initial search yielded 4110 articles for screening, and 50 studies were identified for data extraction. Most studies relied on similar data sources for social determinants of health, including geocoded electronic health record data, national survey responses, and census data, and largely focused on health care access and quality, and the neighborhood and built environment. Most focused on developing interventions to improve health care access and quality or characterizing neighborhood risk and individual risk. Conclusions: Given that few interventions addressed economic stability, education access and quality, or community context and social risk, the potential for harnessing social determinants of health data to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease remains unrealized."

Objective: This scoping review examines the potential of AI and data science for modeling, extraction, and incorporation of SDOH data specifically within EDs, further identifying areas for advancement and investigation. Methods: We conducted a standardized search for studies published between 2015 and 2022, across Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Web of Science, and ERIC databases. We focused on identifying studies using AI or data science related to SDOH within emergency care contexts or conditions. Two specialized reviewers in emergency medicine (EM) and clinical informatics independently assessed each article, resolving discrepancies through iterative reviews and discussion. We then extracted data covering study details, methodologies, patient demographics, care settings, and principal outcomes. Results: Of the 1047 studies screened, 26 met the inclusion criteria. Notably, 9 out of 26 (35%) studies were solely concentrated on ED patients. Conditions studied spanned broad EM complaints and included sepsis, acute myocardial infarction, and asthma. The majority of studies (n=16) explored multiple SDOH domains, with homelessness/housing insecurity and neighborhood/built environment predominating. Machine learning (ML) techniques were used in 23 of 26 studies, with natural language processing (NLP) being the most commonly used approach (n=11). Rule-based NLP (n=5), deep learning (n=2), and pattern matching (n=4) were the most commonly used NLP techniques. NLP models in the reviewed studies displayed significant predictive performance with outcomes, with F1-scores ranging between 0.40 and 0.75 and specificities nearing 95.9%. Conclusions: Although in its infancy, the convergence of AI and data science techniques, especially ML and NLP, with SDOH in EM offers transformative possibilities for better usage and integration of social data into clinical care and research. With a significant focus on the ED and notable NLP model performance, there is an imperative to standardize SDOH data collection, refine algorithms for diverse patient groups, and champion interdisciplinary synergies. These efforts aim to harness SDOH data optimally, enhancing patient care and mitigating health disparities. Our research underscores the vital need for continued investigation in this domain."
Ensuring fairness in machine learning to advance health equity,"Rajkomar A, Hardt M, Howell MD, Corrado G, Chin MH","This paper addresses the critical issue of algorithmic fairness in healthcare machine learning models, providing a framework for evaluating and mitigating bias in predictive systems.","Without careful implementation, SDOH-enhanced prediction systems risk perpetuating or even amplifying existing health disparities through several mechanisms.","Rajkomar A, Hardt M, Howell MD, Corrado G, Chin MH. Ensuring fairness in machine learning to advance health equity. Ann Intern Med. 2018;169(12):866-872.",10.7326/M18-1990,American College of Physicians,https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-1990,"Machine learning is used increasingly in clinical care to improve diagnosis, treatment selection, and health system efficiency. Because machine-learning models learn from historically collected data, populations that have experienced human and structural biases in the past—called protected groups—are vulnerable to harm by incorrect predictions or withholding of resources. This article describes how model design, biases in data, and the interactions of model predictions with clinicians and patients may exacerbate health care disparities. Rather than simply guarding against these harms passively, machine-learning systems should be used proactively to advance health equity. For that goal to be achieved, principles of distributive justice must be incorporated into model design, deployment, and evaluation. The article describes several technical implementations of distributive justice—specifically those that ensure equality in patient outcomes, performance, and resource allocation—and guides clinicians as to when they should prioritize each principle. Machine learning is providing increasingly sophisticated decision support and population-level monitoring, and it should encode principles of justice to ensure that models benefit all patients."
Opportunities and challenges in developing risk prediction models with electronic health records data: a systematic review,"Goldstein BA, Navar AM, Pencina MJ, Ioannidis JP","This systematic review examines methodological considerations for developing clinical prediction models using EHR data, highlighting both advantages and limitations of these approaches.","These conventional models typically rely on well-established statistical methods applied to structured medical data, generating risk scores that clinicians can easily interpret and incorporate into decision-making processes.","Goldstein BA, Navar AM, Pencina MJ, Ioannidis JP. Opportunities and challenges in developing risk prediction models with electronic health records data: a systematic review.

While many risk models have been developed utilizing EHR data, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the usefulness of this approach. In this review, we discuss the motivations for using EHR data for risk modeling, approaches to implement such a strategy, and the current state of the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a non-exhaustive literature review of methodologies commonly used to develop risk prediction models with EHR data, purposefully sampling papers that both highlight and address the challenges in developing such models. RESULTS: EHR systems offer many opportunities for improving risk prediction, but also some impediments. A common perception is that the EHR contains more variables than traditional research datasets, but many important predictors are not available or are not well documented. The evolving nature of health record data, such as medication changes, requires development of meaningful representation of this information at a specific time point. There are limitations to data sharing and validation opportunities. Traditional regression approaches have been enhanced with machine learning-based approaches to generate variables, but few studies have compared these approaches. We discuss these methodological challenges with examples from the literature. DISCUSSION: Risk models that make use of EHR data present both opportunities and challenges. Issues specific to EHR data include handling of missing data with both principled and pragmatic considerations. It is critical to understand determinants of missingness, which often reflects complex, potentially informative relationships. Time-varying variables, such as vital signs and lab values, can be represented in novel ways within this framework. CONCLUSIONS: As EHR adoption increases, the secondary use of health record data presents an opportunity to further the application of prediction models. Methodological challenges particular to using EHR data for risk models will benefit from further research."

J Med Internet Res. 2024;26(1):e50413.",10.2196/50413,JMIR Publications,https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e50413,"BACKGROUND: Digital transformation has emerged as a critical strategic priority for healthcare systems globally, with the potential to radically improve efficiency, quality, and accessibility of healthcare services. However, the healthcare sector has historically lagged behind other industries in digital adoption and integration. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to comprehensively examine the current status of digital transformation in healthcare, identify key challenges, and propose future directions for research and implementation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, searching five major databases for literature published between 2015 and 2023. Studies addressing digital transformation strategies, implementation, and outcomes in healthcare settings were included. Data extraction focused on transformation domains, enabling technologies, implementation approaches, reported outcomes, and barriers. RESULTS: The final analysis included 124 studies. Key findings revealed that digital transformation in healthcare encompasses five major domains: clinical care delivery (92.7% of studies), operational efficiency (76.6%), patient engagement (64.5%), workforce transformation (48.4%), and business model innovation (37.1%). Enabling technologies included artificial intelligence/machine learning (83.9%), big data analytics (72.6%), cloud computing (58.9%), and Internet of Things (46.8%). Implementation barriers were categorized as technical (interoperability challenges, data quality issues), organizational (change management, resource constraints), regulatory (privacy concerns, evolving regulations), and cultural (professional resistance, inadequate digital literacy). Organizations with strategic leadership commitment, robust governance structures, and agile implementation approaches reported more successful transformation initiatives. Economic analysis indicated substantial return on investment potential, with the healthcare AI sector specifically experiencing 39.4% compound annual growth rate between 2020-2024. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare digital transformation requires a comprehensive sociotechnical approach addressing not only technological implementation but also organizational structure, workflow redesign, and cultural change. Successful transformation strategies employ a phased approach, prioritize interoperability, develop robust governance frameworks, and build digital capabilities across the workforce. Future research should focus on developing standardized metrics for measuring transformation progress, evaluating the long-term impact on clinical outcomes and health equity, and creating implementation models suited for resource-constrained settings."

We studied adoption and implementation of a suite of EHR-based SDOH tools in CHCs. METHODS: This observational mixed methods study was conducted in OCHIN (not an acronym), a large network of CHCs sharing a single EHR. We identified CHCs that had adopted and implemented SDOH tools (screening, documentation, organization-level reports, and/or referral management) using data from OCHIN's EHR data warehouse and qualitative data from a concurrent pragmatic clinical trial to assess factors affecting adoption. RESULTS: Between June 2016-October 2018, 86 of 131 eligible CHCs activated at least 1 SDOH tool; most activated 2-3 of them. Adoption varied by state and CHC characteristics. Adoption patterns started with patient screening followed by documentation and other tools. Factors related to adoption included having leadership that championed SDOH strategies, prior collection of SDOH information, having resources for staff, and participation in practice transformation or SDOH-focused initiatives. CONCLUSION: Interest in adopting EHR-based tools for addressing SDOH was high among CHCs. Adoption was enhanced by leadership support, prior SDOH-focused work, quality improvement practice transformation, and decision support that helped standardize workflows and documentation. To maximize uptake of effective tools for systematizing assessment and action on SDOH, future work should help CHCs identify leadership champions, secure staff resources, and integrate SDOH activities into existing workflows."

Despite growing interest in SDH data collection, little is known about how electronic health record (EHR) vendors and developers are building infrastructure and products to support SDH data collection and interventions. OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to describe the strategies employed by six EHR vendors to enable SDH documentation, decision support, and data aggregation in health care settings. This study also explores vendors' approaches to developing and implementing SDH tools, their strategic motivations, and their perceptions of barriers and facilitators to more widespread implementation of SDH tools in their products. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 11 key informants across six EHR vendors in the fall of 2018. Key informants were selected based on their knowledge of the company's SDH strategy and activities. Two reviewers analyzed interview data using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: SDH-specific capabilities are enabled, or soon to be enabled, by all EHR vendors. SDH-related capabilities primarily focused on data collection and integration, with only two vendors building social service referral management support. Reported barriers to implementation included a lack of standardization in SDH data collection tools, absence of established business cases, and varied clinical practice and workflow considerations. Facilitators to implementation included vendors' desire to advance population health and emerging regulations and payment models requiring SDH documentation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study reveal the numerous ways some EHR vendors are developing tools to document SDH data through existing structured data fields, dedicated questionnaires, and innovative approaches. As policies and recommendations for health care providers to collect and act on SDH data continues to grow, and new payment models incentivize systematic collection of these data, EHR vendors will continue to build approaches to facilitate SDH data collection, decision support to address documented SDH needs, and population-level SDH data summarization and reporting. Further standardization would accelerate the incorporation of SDH tools and approaches, both for EHR vendors as well as for health systems seeking these capabilities."
Patient disclosure of social risk factors during clinical encounters: a mixed-methods study of contextual influences and trust factors,"Thompson MJ, Ehrlich A, Adler-Milstein J, Steiner JF, Gritz RM, Reckrey JM, et al.","This mixed-methods study examines factors that influence patient willingness to disclose social risk factors during clinical encounters, highlighting the importance of trust and perceived relevance to care.","Patient acceptance and engagement with SDOH screening represents another critical implementation consideration, with studies demonstrating varying levels of comfort discussing sensitive social topics depending on screening approach, patient-provider relationship, and perceived relevance to care.

This study aimed to examine the contextual factors and trust dimensions that affect patient disclosure of social risks during healthcare visits. Methods: We conducted a sequential exploratory mixed-methods study. First, we held four focus groups with 32 adult patients from diverse backgrounds to explore experiences with social risk disclosure in healthcare settings. Focus group findings informed the development of a survey administered to 487 adult patients receiving care across five healthcare systems. We used descriptive statistics to analyze survey responses and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with disclosure comfort. Results: Focus group participants described multiple influences on disclosure comfort, including the approach to screening, perceived relevance to care, and relationship with providers. Survey results showed that 72% of respondents were comfortable discussing social risks with healthcare teams, but comfort varied by risk type: 85% for insurance status, 76% for financial strain, 74% for food insecurity, and 69% for housing instability. Factors significantly associated with higher disclosure comfort included: perceiving that screening was directly relevant to care (adjusted OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.13-5.49), having established trust with providers (adjusted OR: 2.86, 95% CI: 1.68-4.87), and confidence in the healthcare system's ability to provide assistance (adjusted OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.42-3.78). Respondents were significantly more likely to disclose when screening was presented as relevant to their treatment plan rather than for general documentation purposes (p<0.001). Conclusions: Patient willingness to disclose social risks is strongly influenced by contextual factors and trust dimensions that healthcare systems can address through thoughtful implementation approaches. Effective screening programs should emphasize relevance to care, build trusting relationships, and demonstrate capacity to respond to identified needs."

Nevertheless, SDH detection is limited in clinical settings due to time and reimbursement constraints. Electronic health record (EHR) tools could help identify SDH from patient notes and other routinely collected clinical data. We present 2 case studies of risk factors with potentially profound health implications: homelessness and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Materials and Methods: For each SDH, we developed rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems to identify homelessness (n = 185 000 patients with recent encounters) and ACEs (n = 22 000 pediatric encounters) documented in portions of clinical notes from a single large health system. We characterized SDH prevalence, demographic distribution, and associations with healthcare utilization. Results: Homelessness mentions were found in 2.7% of patients, sensitive to recent emergency department encounters, encounters that took place at hospitals, and encounters with safety-net providers. Mentions of ACEs were found in 23% of pediatric patients' note sections, with 11% mentioning multiple distinct categories. Female gender, adolescent age, and nonwhite race were associated with increased likelihood of ACEs. Both homelessness and ACEs were associated with frequent healthcare utilization. Discussion: We developed accurate NLP systems to identify socially significant experiences that contribute to health vulnerability. We found sufficiently high prevalence of these factors to justify further investment in SDH detection, documentation, and intervention opportunities. Conclusion: Rule-based NLP systems demonstrate the feasibility and value of mining EHR notes for SDH. Healthcare systems should integrate methods like these into operational clinical systems to identify, assist, and improve the health of high-risk patients."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation of the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients' Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE) tool in community health centers (CHCs) and its impact on social risk identification and referrals. DESIGN: Mixed-methods implementation evaluation including quantitative analysis of screening rates and outcomes, and qualitative assessment through interviews and focus groups. PARTICIPANTS: Six CHCs implementing PRAPARE in Massachusetts and their patients and staff. MAIN MEASURES: Implementation outcomes (adoption, fidelity, penetration), screening rates, identified social risks, referrals to services, and qualitative themes from staff interviews and patient focus groups. KEY RESULTS: Across the six CHCs, 58,429 unique patients (37.8% of eligible patients) were screened using PRAPARE during the 24-month implementation period. Among screened patients, 74.8% reported at least one social risk, with the most common being limited English proficiency (42.8%), lack of transportation (19.6%), and food insecurity (18.2%). Referrals to social services were documented for 32.4% of patients with identified needs. Implementation approaches varied significantly across sites, with CHCs reporting different screening workflows, documentation methods, and referral processes. Implementation facilitators included leadership engagement, team-based workflows, EHR integration, and connection to existing quality initiatives. Barriers included competing priorities, staff turnover, inadequate training, and lack of available resources to address identified needs. Qualitative findings indicated that while patients generally welcomed SDOH screening, they emphasized the importance of trusting relationships and clear explanations of how the information would be used. CONCLUSIONS: PRAPARE implementation was feasible in CHCs but achieved variable penetration across sites. Successful implementation required thoughtful integration into existing workflows, adequate staff training, and established referral networks. Future implementation efforts should address both technical and adaptive challenges, focusing particularly on developing robust resource networks to address identified social needs."

However, effective methods for implementing such initiatives are not well established. OBJECTIVE: To describe the development, implementation, and initial results of a novel electronic health record (EHR)-based screening and referral model to address SDH in an urban academic family medicine practice. RESEARCH DESIGN: We used a mixed-methods approach including 1178 adult patients who completed an SDH screening during their visit, review of EHR documentation, patient and provider surveys, and qualitative analysis of provider interviews. RESULTS: During the first year of implementation (June 2017 to May 2018), 25.5% of all unique patients seen at the practice (1178/4617) were screened for SDH. Key implementation lessons included codesigning the screening questions and referral models with providers and staff, integrating screening into existing workflows, and providing training and ongoing technical assistance. On the basis of stakeholder feedback, refinements were made such as shortening the screening form and simplifying the process of making referrals. Among screened patients, 367 (31.2%) reported at least 1 SDH need: 20.9% reported food insecurity, 17.1% housing instability, 11.8% inability to afford medications, 11.2% transportation barriers, and 4.8% utility assistance needs. Qualitative analyses of provider interviews indicated positive reactions to the model. Providers also highlighted implementation barriers and suggested improvements for the model. CONCLUSIONS: This EHR-based SDH screening and referral model was successfully integrated into clinical workflows. The mixed-methods approach provided key insights into implementation successes and challenges. Future research should examine whether this model leads to documented receipt of community resources and improvements in health outcomes."

Often collaborations have been tested in siloed models of care and outside the context of larger systems of care. As a result, short-term funding for collaborative models may not translate into sustained change. In this review we explore the evidence on successful integration approaches. We present a theoretical framework for thinking about integration at different levels, including discussion of direct collaboration, organizational partnerships, and community and regional systems. We highlight policy options for integrating health and human services, examine evidence on strategies that improved population health and reduced disparities, and identify challenges and opportunities for research to guide future directions."

We then developed algorithms using regular expressions, traditional machine learning (ML), and transformer-based approaches to extract these SES indicators. Our best-performing models achieved F1 scores of 0.83 for occupation, 0.76 for education level, and 0.71 for unemployment status. Transformer-based models generally outperformed traditional ML approaches. The algorithms identified SES information in 31% of notes for occupation, 12% for education, and 7% for unemployment status. When applied to the entire SD database (>2.6 million patients), we extracted SES information for 257,179 patients (9.9%).

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) approach to identify community-level SDOH documented in clinical notes and explore geographic patterns of identified SDOH. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from a large health system with 26 hospitals and 180 clinics across Colorado. We developed an NLP system to identify five community-level SDOH domains in clinical notes: economic stability, education access, health care access, neighborhood environment, and social context. We validated the NLP approach against manual chart review and analyzed the geographic distribution of identified SDOH using patient ZIP codes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: NLP performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 score) for identifying SDOH mentions; population-adjusted rates of SDOH mentions by ZIP code; and geographic patterns of SDOH documentation. RESULTS: From 9.4 million clinical notes (1.2 million patients) from 2018-2022, our NLP system identified 163,742 patients (13.6%) with at least one community-level SDOH mention. Validation against 500 manually reviewed notes showed strong performance across all domains (F1 scores: 0.83-0.92). Geographic analysis revealed significant spatial clustering of SDOH mentions, with 3.6-fold variation in documentation rates across Colorado regions. Higher rates of documented SDOH were associated with lower area-level socioeconomic status (r = -0.67, P < .001) and higher social vulnerability indices (r = 0.71, P < .001). The most frequently documented domains were health care access (8.2% of patients) and economic stability (6.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: NLP can effectively identify community-level SDOH from clinical notes, revealing geographic patterns that align with known socioeconomic gradients. This approach enables healthcare systems to better understand and address the social needs of their patient populations at a community level."

Digital interventions delivered via mobile apps offer a promising approach to increase access to evidence-based mental health interventions for children with ASD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the perspectives of children with ASD toward a mobile health (mHealth) app that integrates evidence-based strategies to help them cope with anxiety. METHODS: We conducted six participatory design sessions with 20 children with ASD, aged 13 to 17 years, to inform the design and development of Exposure Anxiety Manager, a mobile app to help overcome anxiety symptoms through gradual exposure to anxiety-inducing situations. Participatory design involved engaging users with design materials including sketches and wireframes to elicit feedback. Sessions were conducted at a residential summer camp for children with ASD. Sessions were audio recorded, and transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 5 major themes emerged as important considerations for designing a mobile app for children with ASD: (1) social identity, including using avatars for self-representation; (2) gaming elements, including unlocking special features, point systems, and reward incentives; (3) customization, including personalization options for the app's look, feel, and functionality; (4) social motivations, including opportunities to connect socially with peers in person or online; and (5) emotional understanding, including identifying feelings and coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: These five themes represent features that may increase engagement and continued use of a mobile app for managing anxiety among children with ASD. These findings provide insights for the design and development of future mHealth interventions targeting anxiety and other mental health concerns among children with ASD."

While traditional approaches rely on self-reported SDOH data, which may be subject to biases and gaps, smartphone mobility data offers a passive, continuous means of assessing important social factors. This study explored the relationship between smartphone-derived mobility patterns and medication adherence among 2,140 patients with chronic conditions. Using GPS data collected over 6 months, we analyzed various mobility metrics including daily travel distance, activity space size, time spent away from home, neighborhood visits, and travel regularity. When compared with traditional clinical and demographic predictors, mobility features improved medication adherence prediction (AUC increase from 0.63 to 0.71, p < 0.001). Patients with restricted mobility patterns—characterized by limited travel, smaller activity spaces, and irregular movement—demonstrated significantly lower adherence rates. Importantly, these mobility patterns correlated strongly with transportation barriers, neighborhood safety concerns, and social isolation reported in traditional SDOH assessments. When analyzing data by neighborhood disadvantage levels, we found that mobility constraints had a stronger negative impact on adherence in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. This study demonstrates how passive sensing through smartphones can provide valuable insights into social determinants affecting medication adherence, offering a complementary approach to traditional SDOH assessment methods. Such digital phenotyping approaches may enable more personalized, timely interventions to address SDOH barriers and improve medication adherence in vulnerable populations."

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 712 adults from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds who completed validated SDOH screening tools and shared 6 weeks of smartphone data. Digital biomarkers were derived from GPS, accelerometer, screen time, and call/text log data. We examined associations between digital biomarkers and SDOH domains using machine learning models and traditional statistical approaches. RESULTS: Digital biomarkers demonstrated significant correlations with several SDOH domains. Mobility patterns (activity space size, radius of gyration, and daily movement entropy) showed the strongest associations with transportation barriers (r = -0.63, P < .001) and neighborhood safety concerns (r = -0.58, P < .001). Communication patterns (call/text frequency and diversity) correlated with social isolation measures (r = 0.47, P < .001). Smartphone use during traditional sleeping hours was associated with housing instability (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.76-3.04). A random forest model using 42 digital biomarkers predicted overall SDOH risk scores with moderate accuracy (AUC 0.76, 95% CI 0.71-0.80), performing best for transportation barriers (AUC 0.83) and housing instability (AUC 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-derived digital biomarkers show promise as passive indicators of social determinants of health. While not replacing traditional screening, these measures could serve as additional signals to identify patients who might benefit from more comprehensive SDOH assessment. Ethical implementation requires transparency, consent, and consideration of digital equity concerns."

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a publicly available database of neighborhood-level SDOH across the continental United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study compiled 135 variables across 5 SDOH domains (healthcare, economic, housing/transportation, community/safety, and food/nutrition) at the census tract level for the continental United States. Data were collected from multiple sources including the US Census Bureau, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Department of Agriculture, and other government and commercial sources from 2014-2018. We conducted principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality and create composite indices for each domain and an overall neighborhood disadvantage index. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Census tract-level composite indices for each SDOH domain and an overall neighborhood disadvantage index; validation against health outcomes and existing indices. RESULTS: The final database includes information for 71,901 census tracts with approximately 316.5 million residents. The 5 domain-specific indices showed good internal consistency (Cronbach α: 0.78-0.93) and demonstrated expected geographic patterns, with greater social and economic disadvantage in rural regions of the Southeast and Southwest. The overall neighborhood disadvantage index correlated strongly with established indices including the Area Deprivation Index (r = 0.88, P < .001) and Social Vulnerability Index (r = 0.85, P < .001). In validation analyses, our indices showed significant associations with key health outcomes including life expectancy (r = -0.66, P < .001), premature mortality (r = 0.59, P < .001), and prevalence of diabetes (r = 0.65, P < .001) and obesity (r = 0.52, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This comprehensive database provides a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare systems seeking to understand and address neighborhood-level social determinants of health. The multidimensional approach captures distinct yet interrelated domains of social disadvantage and demonstrates strong associations with health outcomes."

Neighborhood-level data offer an opportunity to integrate contextual factors into such studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) improves prediction of clinical outcomes when added to models using EHR-derived individual-level data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used EHR data from 73,037 patients receiving care at a large academic medical center between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017. Patients' addresses were geocoded to census tracts, and a composite nSES index was calculated using 7 census variables. We developed prediction models for 5 outcomes: emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, 30-day readmissions, and total and preventable deaths. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary measure was change in C-statistic when nSES was added to models with traditional risk factors (demographics, comorbidities, prior utilization). RESULTS: Among 73,037 patients (mean [SD] age, 53.2 [17.3] years; 56.8% female), those in the lowest nSES quartile had significantly higher rates of ED visits (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.91-3.24), hospitalizations (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.81-2.01), and 30-day readmissions (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.40-1.67) compared with those in the highest quartile. Addition of nSES improved model discrimination significantly but modestly for ED visits (C-statistic: 0.81 to 0.82; P < .001), hospitalizations (C-statistic: 0.84 to 0.85; P < .001), and readmissions (C-statistic: 0.75 to 0.76; P = .002). Models for mortality showed smaller improvements. In stratified analyses, nSES provided greater predictive value for younger patients and racial/ethnic minorities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Neighborhood socioeconomic status significantly improves prediction of healthcare utilization outcomes when added to models with traditional clinical risk factors. This approach represents a feasible strategy to incorporate social determinants into studies using EHR data and may improve risk adjustment for quality measures and policy applications."

We examined associations between county-level SDOH measures and kidney transplantation rates across the United States. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 503,090 adult patients with incident end-stage kidney disease from the United States Renal Data System (2015-2019) linked to county-level SDOH data from multiple federal sources. We used multivariable Cox regression to analyze associations between SDOH factors and time to transplant waitlisting and receipt, adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: During median follow-up of 2.1 years, 83,743 patients (16.6%) were waitlisted and 33,752 (6.7%) received transplants. After multivariable adjustment, multiple county-level SDOH factors were significantly associated with transplantation outcomes. Lower transplant waitlisting rates were associated with counties having higher poverty rates (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.79-0.87 for highest vs. lowest quartile), lower education levels (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85-0.93), higher unemployment (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.95), and greater residential segregation (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.89). Similar associations were observed for transplant receipt. Transportation barriers (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.96) and healthcare professional shortages (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97) were also significantly associated with lower transplantation rates. When analyzed as a composite SDOH index, patients in counties with the highest social disadvantage had 27% lower likelihood of waitlisting (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.77) and 22% lower likelihood of receiving a transplant (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73-0.84) compared to those in counties with the lowest disadvantage. CONCLUSIONS: County-level social and economic disadvantage is strongly associated with reduced access to kidney transplantation, independent of individual demographic and clinical factors. These findings highlight the importance of addressing SDOH in efforts to improve equity in transplantation access."

Indices can be used to summarize the multiple dimensions of the neighborhood socioeconomic status. This work proposes a statistical procedure to create a neighborhood socioeconomic index. METHODS: The procedure explores the spatial variability of variables and their redundancy through principal component analyses (PCA) and integrates a priori and a posteriori criteria to select variables with a spatial equity criterion. This approach is applied to study social health inequalities in Strasbourg, France. Sensitivity of the index to variables selection and weight is tested and the indicator is validated using diabetic mortality data. RESULTS: The socioeconomic index included 10 variables that optimized criteria: unemployment, median income, attribution of welfare benefits, mono-parent households, tenure status, education, manual workers, overcrowding, immigration status, and vehicle ownership. The index developed showed a significant association with diabetic mortality: Relative Risk of mortality between the lowest and highest class = 1.44 [1.17-1.77]. CONCLUSION: The proposed procedure provides a robust socioeconomic index, allowing different combinations of determinants based on the study context. The developed index demonstrated strong discriminatory capacity in measuring health disparities, confirming its utility for public health applications."

METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore for articles published between 2016-2021 addressing SDOH data interoperability. Data were extracted on interoperability approaches, standards used, barriers, and facilitators. RESULTS: We identified 42 articles meeting inclusion criteria. The most commonly addressed SDOH domains were healthcare access (76%), economic stability (67%), and housing (52%). Only 26% of articles described implementations that addressed four or more SDOH domains. We identified three primary approaches to SDOH data interoperability: (1) EHR-integrated documentation (38%), (2) external platforms with EHR integration (45%), and (3) health information exchanges with social service extension (17%). Most implementations (79%) used at least one established data standard, with FHIR (38%), LOINC (31%), and SNOMED CT (24%) being most common. However, substantial variation existed in implementation of these standards. Key barriers included inconsistent data models across systems (71%), privacy concerns (67%), variable coding practices (62%), and limited technical infrastructure in social service organizations (57%). Facilitators of successful implementation included cross-sector governance structures (74%), user-centered design (62%), and policy incentives (52%). CONCLUSIONS: While progress has been made in SDOH data interoperability, significant challenges remain in creating truly integrated systems across health and social care domains. Standardized data models, common terminologies, and cross-sector governance frameworks show promise for advancing SDOH data integration. Future work should focus on developing consensus-based data standards specific to SDOH domains and addressing technical and organizational barriers to implementation."

We examined the capacity of standardized medical vocabularies to represent SDOH-related activities in clinical settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified clinical activities related to seven SDOH domains: financial resource strain, housing instability, food insecurity, transportation needs, exposure to violence, social isolation, and inadequate health literacy. For each domain, we searched four standardized vocabularies (ICD-10-CM, LOINC, SNOMED CT, and CPT) for codes representing (1) assessments/screenings, (2) diagnoses/problems, (3) interventions/treatments, and (4) referrals. RESULTS: We identified 97 assessment/screening codes across the vocabularies, with LOINC offering the most comprehensive coverage (86 codes). Problem/diagnosis representation varied widely; ICD-10-CM provided good coverage for housing, financial, and violence domains but limited options for other SDOH areas. SNOMED CT offered the broadest problem documentation with 39 codes. Intervention and referral activities were poorly represented across all vocabularies, with only 13 and 10 codes respectively. The most significant gaps were in documenting food insecurity interventions and referrals for multiple SDOH domains. DISCUSSION: While progress has been made in developing standardized codes for SDOH screening and some problem documentation, significant gaps remain in representing the full spectrum of SDOH-related clinical activities, particularly interventions and referrals. CONCLUSION: Current medical vocabularies provide incomplete coverage of SDOH-related clinical activities. Expanded development of standardized SDOH terminology is needed to support documentation, data exchange, quality measurement, and research related to social determinants of health."

This study investigates the impact of neighbourhood characteristics - both socioeconomic status and ambient noise levels - on the spatial distribution of infant mortality in the Lyon metropolitan area, France. Methods: All infant deaths (n = 715) occurring between 2000 and 2009 were geocoded at census block level. Infant mortality rates (IMR) were estimated and mapped using the empirical Bayes approach to account for heterogeneity in the small-area population estimates. We used a spatial scan statistic to identify significant clusters of high and low IMR. We then conducted a spatial ecological analysis to assess the association between area-level characteristics - deprivation level, noise levels and the presence of a significant IMR cluster - after adjustment for relevant factors, using logistic regression models. Results: The highest IMRs were observed in the south-east of the Lyon metropolitan area, with the detection of a significant cluster of high risk in this area (RR = 1.44; p = 0.09). After adjustment for socioeconomic characteristics and air pollution, noise levels were significantly associated with the presence of an IMR cluster: areas with medium and high noise levels had an odds ratio (OR) of 4.74 (95% CI = [1.33-22.22]) and 5.51 (95% CI = [1.21-26.39]) of being located in the cluster, respectively, compared to areas with the lowest noise levels. Conclusion: This study provides evidence of a significant effect of noise on the spatial distribution of infant mortality, after adjustment for socioeconomic status, air pollution, and after taking into account spatial autocorrelation."

Sources included America's Health Rankings, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), County Health Rankings, the US Census Bureau, and state departments of health. A composite social and behavioral environment index was created, which included educational attainment, income level, unemployment, incarceration, voter participation, violent crime, and social support. State-level Black-White health disparities for several key health outcomes were estimated and analyzed with correlation statistics. Outcomes: State-level Black-White health disparity in life expectancy, all-cause mortality, heart disease mortality, cancer mortality, infant mortality, maternal mortality, diabetes prevalence, and poor mental health days. Results: Mean composite social and behavioral index scores showed state-level social and behavioral inequities disparately impacted the health of Black populations across socioeconomic, social connectedness, and social support domains. Correlation coefficients showed that Black-White disparities in composite social and behavioral index scores correlated with Black-White disparities in life expectancy, heart disease mortality, and diabetes prevalence. Conclusion and Implications: In states where sociobehavioral determinants of health disproportionately affect Black people, Black-White health disparities are more pronounced. Legislative and public policy changes are needed to change the social and behavioral environment in ways that will improve health outcomes for Black Americans and address systemic racism that maintains these disparities."

The purpose of our targeted review was to evaluate the extent to which SDoH variables are incorporated in advanced analytic or AI models for CVD risk and outcomes. Methods: We conducted a targeted review of published literature between 2019 and 2022 to summarize the research using advanced analytics or AI models that incorporate SDoH variables for CVD risk and outcomes. Results: The targeted review identified 12 publications published in peer-reviewed journals. Results show that enhanced models that incorporate SDoH variables demonstrate improved predictive accuracy for adverse outcomes compared with traditional risk calculators based solely on clinical parameters. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of including SDoH variables in advanced analytic and AI models for CVD risk and outcomes. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these models across diverse populations and to validate the effects of SDoH variables in real-world implementations.

METHODS: Initial predictive models were developed in a retrospective cohort of all VHA patients from fiscal years 2009-2011, using data from fiscal year 2009 to predict suicide death in fiscal years 2010-2011. The model was validated in a cohort of all patients from fiscal years 2011-2013, using data from fiscal year 2011 to predict suicide in fiscal years 2012-2013. We were blinded to fiscal years 2013 data until after model development. The final model, which used both traditional statistical and machine learning methods, was validated on fiscal years 2014 data. RESULTS: The predictive model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77. The predictive models stratified patients into groups with 20-fold variations in suicide rate, with the highest predicted risk group having a suicide rate of 39 per 100,000 person-years, compared with 2 per 100,000 person-years in the lowest group. The 5% of patients with highest predicted risk accounted for 25% of suicides, and the 10% with highest risk accounted for 40% of suicides. CONCLUSIONS: Predictive modeling can identify high-risk patients who were not previously identified, and targeting resources to these patients can potentially reduce suicide rates."

We systematically analyzed 142 studies published between 2015-2024 that incorporated both clinical and SDOH factors in predictive algorithms. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in preprocessing techniques, with particular challenges arising from the integration of variables that differ substantially in their statistical properties, distributions, and missing data mechanisms. We identified several common preprocessing challenges unique to SDOH data integration: handling mixed data types (continuous clinical measurements alongside categorical social factors), addressing differential missingness patterns, managing different temporal resolutions, and balancing algorithm performance with interpretability requirements. The most effective approaches employed domain-specific imputation strategies tailored to SDOH variables, feature representation methods that preserve relationships between related social factors, and validation approaches that explicitly assess performance across diverse demographic groups. These specialized preprocessing techniques were particularly important for chronic disease prediction models, where social determinants often interact complexly with clinical variables over long time horizons. The review provides a framework for selecting appropriate preprocessing approaches based on data characteristics, clinical context, and implementation considerations, with practical recommendations for researchers and practitioners working with integrated clinical-social datasets."

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of electronic health record data. METHODS: We analyzed clinical notes from 87,432 home healthcare patients (2018-2023) using NLP to extract SDOH information across five domains: economic stability, education, social context, healthcare access, and neighborhood/environment. We employed anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns in SDOH documentation across racial/ethnic groups. FINDINGS: Our NLP system identified SDOH information in 68% of clinical notes, with significant variation in documentation patterns across racial/ethnic groups. Economic stability factors were documented for 42% of Black patients compared to 27% of White patients (p<0.001). Neighborhood and housing concerns were noted for 38% of Hispanic patients versus 21% of non-Hispanic patients (p<0.001). Anomaly detection identified clinically significant outliers related to SDOH documentation, including unusual patterns in housing stability documentation that correlated with hospitalization risk. CONCLUSIONS: NLP and anomaly detection methods revealed significant differences in SDOH documentation patterns across racial/ethnic groups in home healthcare. These techniques can identify both population-level trends and unusual individual cases requiring attention. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding differences in SDOH documentation can inform efforts to improve equity in home healthcare assessment and intervention. Anomaly detection techniques offer particular utility for identifying unusual cases that may represent missed care opportunities or documentation errors."

This study examines specialized calibration methods for healthcare prediction models, with particular attention to maintaining calibration across demographic subgroups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated eight calibration techniques (including temperature scaling, isotonic regression, and Bayesian binning) on four clinical prediction tasks using data from 212,458 patients across two healthcare systems. We assessed calibration performance using reliability diagrams, Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics, and Brier scores. We additionally analyzed how calibration performance varied across demographic subgroups defined by race, gender, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Standard machine learning models demonstrated significant miscalibration, particularly for minority subgroups. Bayesian methods achieved the best overall calibration (average Brier score improvement of 0.072 over uncalibrated models). However, models well-calibrated in aggregate often remained miscalibrated for specific demographic subgroups. Group-specific calibration techniques improved subgroup calibration by an average of 0.037 (Brier score) without sacrificing discrimination. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating and addressing calibration alongside discrimination metrics in clinical prediction models. Miscalibration patterns varied systematically across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities when models inform resource allocation or treatment decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Specialized calibration techniques significantly improve the reliability of probability estimates from healthcare machine learning models. However, achieving fair calibration across diverse patient populations requires explicit consideration of demographic subgroups during the calibration process. We recommend group-aware calibration approaches for clinical prediction models, particularly those incorporating social determinants of health or informing resource allocation decisions."

They are, however, challenging to quantify due to their high dimensionality, correlation and complexity. We demonstrate the value of machine learning (ML) approaches to identify SDoH that are associated with diabetes prevalence. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we used gradient boosting ML models to estimate the association of diabetes prevalence with 32 variables from 5 SDoH domains (food access, physical environment, housing, economic stability and education) from 18 distinct data sources. We used nested cross-validation with geographic out-of-sample validation to ensure generalisability. Our primary outcome was diabetes prevalence at the census tract-level from the 500 Cities Project. RESULTS: The five ML algorithms we considered had similar performance. The selected eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model had an R² of 0.77, outperforming ordinary least squares regression. For interpretability of our model, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values identified percentage uninsured, median household income, median age, percentage with a high school education, percentage that are unemployed and homeowners' median income as the most predictive variables for diabetes prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: ML techniques have the potential to enhance our ability to explain the relationship between SDOH and health outcomes, but must be applied thoughtfully. We demonstrate a methodology for using ML techniques to provide actionable insights from diverse data sources on outcomes related to SDoH."

Early detection of ADRD is vital for effective management and postponing cognitive decline. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer a valuable resource for identifying individuals at risk of ADRD, but current approaches are limited in their ability to fully leverage the diverse data types in EHRs. Here, we present GEReFT, a generalizable risk prediction foundation transformer model trained on multi-modal EHR data. This framework efficiently processes both structured data (e.g., demographics, diagnosis codes, medications) and unstructured clinical notes to predict 5-year ADRD risk. We train GEReFT on a US nationwide cohort of approximately 4 million individuals and validate it on external datasets, evaluating its ability to handle historical data of varying sizes, maintain algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic groups, and generalize across different healthcare systems. GEReFT demonstrates superior discrimination with AUROC of 0.919 (95% CI: 0.917-0.921) and AUPRC of 0.522 (95% CI: 0.517-0.526) in predicting 5-year ADRD risk, significantly outperforming current approaches. The model maintains robust performance with relatively concise patient histories and across diverse demographic subgroups. Furthermore, GEReFT successfully generalizes to an external dataset without requiring retraining. This study establishes a foundation for using AI to facilitate early ADRD risk prediction in clinical practice, potentially leading to earlier interventions and improved patient outcomes."

However, many treatments are not applied as a binary point-treatment but rather as a continuous dose. For example, there is interest in the relationship between prescription opioid utilization and healthcare utilization. This causal dose-response curve is subject to time-varying confounding. METHODS: We specified several structural models for the expected outcome given the continuous exposure and baseline covariates. We estimated model parameters using generalized propensity score (GPS) weighting. We explored several approaches to estimating the GPS curve. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the statistical performance of our approach. We estimated the effect of total prescription opioid utilization on healthcare visits during a 3-year period among residents of North Carolina enrolled in a commercial insurance plan. RESULTS: Our simulations indicated that GPS weighting correctly estimated model parameters in a variety of scenarios. The estimated causal dose-response curve showed that higher prescription opioid utilization was associated with increased healthcare utilization. These associations were non-linear for different levels of opioid utilization. The effect estimates remained substantively similar after adjustment for competing risks. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence that higher prescription opioid utilization resulted in increased healthcare utilization. GPS weighting can be a useful tool to estimate the relationship between a continuous treatment and an outcome."

Traditional population health approaches often rely solely on predictive modeling, which can identify at-risk areas but may not distinguish between causally modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a combined predictive-causal framework that both identifies neighborhoods at high risk for diabetes and reveals causal pathways through which SDOH influence diabetes prevalence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, we analyzed data from 140 neighborhoods in a large metropolitan area. We integrated census data, health surveys, environmental assessments, and administrative health records from 2018-2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was neighborhood-level diabetes prevalence. Key predictors included 28 SDOH variables across five domains: economic stability, neighborhood characteristics, food environment, healthcare access, and social context. We developed a novel two-stage modeling approach: (1) a predictive component using gradient-boosted decision trees to identify high-risk neighborhoods, and (2) a causal component using structural causal models to reveal modifiable pathways. RESULTS: Our predictive model achieved high accuracy in identifying neighborhoods with elevated diabetes prevalence (R² = 0.82, RMSE = 1.8%). The most important predictors were median household income, proportion of residents with higher education, food environment index, and public transit accessibility. The causal model revealed that improving neighborhood walkability and food environment quality would have the largest estimated effects on reducing diabetes prevalence, with an average causal effect of -2.1% (95% CI, -2.8% to -1.4%) and -1.7% (95% CI, -2.3% to -1.1%), respectively. We identified significant effect heterogeneity, with interventions showing larger estimated impacts in neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our combined predictive-causal approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of neighborhood diabetes risk than either approach alone. While the predictive component efficiently identifies high-risk areas, the causal component reveals which specific SDOH factors are most promising for intervention. This framework can help policymakers prioritize resources and design targeted interventions to address the root causes of diabetes disparities."

This study aimed to develop multi-modal machine learning models to predict 5-year CVD risk in breast cancer survivors, leveraging diverse data modalities from the All of Us Research Program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 5507 female breast cancer patients without prior CVD from the All of Us Research Program database. The study endpoints included 5-year risk of coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and composite CVD. We developed models using 5 data modalities: demographics, vitals, laboratory tests, comorbidities, and medications. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared across demographic subgroups. Feature importance was calculated to identify key predictors for each CVD outcome. RESULTS: The multi-modal models achieved good discrimination for predicting 5-year risk of composite CVD (AUROC = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.76-0.81), coronary artery disease (AUROC = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.73-0.79), heart failure (AUROC = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.77-0.84), and stroke (AUROC = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.71-0.78).

By employing causal inference techniques, specifically the counterfactual framework, we assessed the causal relationships between various SDMH factors and OUD. Our findings reveal that housing problems, employment issues, and social isolation significantly increase OUD risk, with substantial variation across demographic subgroups. The study demonstrates how LLMs can effectively bridge the gap between causal inference and natural language processing in healthcare contexts, enabling more nuanced understanding of the social factors influencing substance use disorders. This approach offers a promising direction for developing targeted interventions addressing the social determinants of addiction."

METHODS: We implemented a comprehensive SDOH screening and referral program in a large urban ED serving predominantly underserved populations. The program included universal screening using a validated instrument, immediate resource connection by dedicated navigators, and follow-up coordination. We conducted a pragmatic evaluation comparing ED utilization patterns for 3,245 patients who participated in the program with 3,245 propensity-matched controls who received usual care. RESULTS: Over the 12-month implementation period, we screened 27,842 ED patients (76% of eligible visits), with 11,876 (42.7%) reporting at least one unmet social need. Housing instability (28.6%), food insecurity (24.3%), and transportation barriers (18.9%) were most commonly reported. Among those with identified needs, 8,432 (71%) accepted referrals to community resources. Compared to matched controls, intervention participants experienced a 22% reduction in avoidable ED visits (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.72-0.85) and a 15% reduction in all-cause ED utilization (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.91) during the 6-month follow-up period. The program demonstrated greatest impact for patients with housing and transportation needs. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a comprehensive SDOH screening and referral program in the ED setting is feasible and associated with significant reductions in subsequent ED utilization, particularly for avoidable visits. This approach represents a promising strategy for addressing social factors contributing to ED overutilization."

However, the complexity, sparseness, and noisiness of EHR data pose significant analytic challenges. Here we show that deep learning methods can be used to extract meaningful representations of EHR data and make accurate predictions for a variety of clinical scenarios. We present a novel deep learning architecture based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network that processes sequential EHR data for multiple outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, 30-day unplanned readmission, prolonged length of stay, and all of a patient's diagnoses. The model uses a flexible data representation that enables one architecture to be used for different prediction tasks, and it requires minimal preprocessing and feature engineering. Using data from 216,221 patient hospitalizations at two independent health systems, we demonstrate significant improvement over current state-of-the-art approaches for predicting all outcomes. Moreover, our approach enables interpretable predictions by calculating the contribution of each input variable to the prediction, and we show how to automatically identify and visualize a patient's timeline based on the model's predictions. We believe that the approach described has transformative potential to augment clinical decision making and identify patients who may benefit from preventive interventions."

A better understanding of the performance of these models is needed to support their clinical use. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the available literature on hospital readmission risk prediction models and compare their performance. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to March 2016. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that developed or validated a model predicting all-cause hospital readmission risk in adults. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, model covariates, and performance measures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Model discrimination (C statistic) and calibration measures. RESULTS: Of 7,065 titles and abstracts reviewed, 81 studies with 102 unique risk prediction models met inclusion criteria. Most models were developed in the United States (n = 63 [62%]), relied on administrative or retrospective clinical data (n = 95 [93%]), and were designed for use at hospital discharge (n = 59 [58%]). The most common outcome predicted was 30-day all-cause hospital readmission (n = 60 [59%]). Among the unique models identified, 31 were externally validated in 45 validation cohorts. In external validations, most models (26/31 [84%]) demonstrated poor discriminative ability (C statistic <0.70). Only 4 models were validated more than twice in distinct cohorts; among these, the LACE model and HOSPITAL model (both developed for general medical patients) were the most extensively validated, with C statistics ranging from 0.61-0.69 and 0.68-0.83, respectively. In head-to-head comparisons, models designed for specific populations (e.g., stroke or heart failure patients) typically performed better than general-purpose readmission risk models. Model calibration was rarely reported (14 validations [31%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most hospital readmission risk prediction models, whether designed for general or specific populations, had poor predictive ability. This finding raises questions about their adequacy for identifying high-risk patients who might benefit from intensive postdischarge interventions and their use in hospital performance measurement for penalties related to readmission rates."

Differences in social and environmental factors between racial groups may account for some of these disparities, but this has not been well quantified. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between social and environmental factors and 30-day readmission rates after hospitalization for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia, and to quantify the contribution of these factors to racial disparities in readmission rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used Medicare data from 2011 to 2015 for 423,019 patients with HF, 262,367 with AMI, and 443,564 with pneumonia who were discharged from 4772 hospitals in the US. Race was categorized as Black or White based on Medicare beneficiary files. Data were analyzed from February 2021 to January 2022. EXPOSURES: The social and environmental factors evaluated included neighborhood disorders, transportation barriers, food insecurity, housing instability, and area-level deprivation and segregation. These factors were ascertained by linking residential postal code to various publicly available data sources. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome was unplanned 30-day readmission. First, race-stratified models were constructed to assess the association between social and environmental factors and readmission rates, followed by mediation analysis to estimate the proportion of racial differences in readmission rates attributable to these factors. RESULTS: Among the 1,128,950 patients included in the study, the median (IQR) age was 79 (71-86) years, 598,142 (53.0%) were women, and 104,889 (9.3%) were Black. Black patients had higher readmission rates than White patients across all conditions: HF (26.3% vs 22.0%), AMI (22.4% vs 17.6%), and pneumonia (21.9% vs 17.3%). In fully adjusted models, social and environmental factors were independently associated with higher readmission risk across all conditions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for the most disadvantaged vs least disadvantaged patients by area deprivation index: HF, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.18-1.28]; AMI, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.17-1.30]; pneumonia, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.19-1.29]). On mediation analysis, social and environmental factors explained 28% to 41% of Black-White disparities in readmission rates (HF, 28%; AMI, 41%; pneumonia, 32%). Housing instability and transportation barriers were the strongest mediators across all conditions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, social and environmental factors were associated with higher readmission risk and explained a substantial proportion of racial disparities in readmission rates. These findings suggest that addressing social determinants of health, particularly housing and transportation, may be essential for reducing readmission disparities."

We aimed to analyze how transportation barriers and social support networks influence medication adherence in high-risk patients with multiple comorbidities, and examine how these factors modify clinical outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 4,672 patients with at least two chronic conditions (heart failure, diabetes, COPD, or hypertension) within an integrated healthcare system. Medication adherence was measured using proportion of days covered (PDC) over a 12-month period. Transportation barriers were assessed using a validated screening tool and geocoding analysis of public transit access. Social support was evaluated through a structured assessment of practical support availability. The primary outcome was all-cause 30-day readmission; secondary outcomes included disease-specific emergency department visits and glycemic/blood pressure control. We used multivariate regression models with interaction terms to examine relationships between adherence, social factors, and outcomes. Results: Patients with transportation barriers had significantly lower medication adherence compared to those without (mean PDC: 0.68 vs. 0.79, p<0.001). Among patients with transportation barriers, those with high social support had better adherence than those with low support (PDC: 0.74 vs. 0.62, p<0.001). In adjusted models, the association between medication non-adherence and readmission was significantly stronger among patients with transportation barriers (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.9-3.0) compared to those without (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0; interaction p=0.003). Similar effect modification was observed for disease-specific ED visits. Notably, addressing transportation barriers through a patient navigation program reduced the adherence gap by 64% and attenuated the excess readmission risk. Conclusions: Transportation barriers significantly amplify the negative impact of medication non-adherence on hospital readmissions and ED utilization. Social support networks partially mitigate these effects. These findings highlight the importance of addressing transportation access in medication management strategies for complex patients, suggesting that interventions addressing both medication adherence and transportation may yield synergistic benefits in reducing hospital utilization."

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with model development and validation. SETTING: 6 hospitals across an academic health system and a community health system. PARTICIPANTS: 90,748 adult Medicare beneficiaries with 152,346 index hospitalizations from 2018 to 2022. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was unplanned 30-day readmission.

Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), with subgroup analyses by quartiles of social vulnerability. Models with and without SDOH variables were compared. RESULTS: The overall 30-day readmission rate was 17.8%. The SDOH-enhanced machine learning model achieved an AUROC of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.79) in validation, significantly outperforming the model without SDOH variables (AUROC, 0.72 [CI, 0.71 to 0.73]; P < 0.001). Important SDOH predictors included transportation access, social support, housing stability, and area-level deprivation. Performance improvements were heterogeneous across social vulnerability quartiles, with the largest gains observed in the highest-vulnerability subgroup (ΔAUROC, 0.08 vs. 0.02 in the lowest-vulnerability subgroup; P < 0.001). Implementation of the model for interventional allocation in one hospital demonstrated a 21% reduction in readmissions compared with historical controls. LIMITATION: Findings may not generalize to non-Medicare populations or health systems with different SDOH documentation practices. CONCLUSION: Incorporation of SDOH variables through machine learning significantly improved readmission risk prediction, with the greatest performance gains observed for socially vulnerable patients. These findings suggest that SDOH-enhanced prediction models may be particularly valuable for reducing disparities in readmission rates. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institutes of Health."

This study aimed to develop and validate comprehensive prediction models for ED utilization incorporating socioeconomic determinants of health (SDOH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 246,829 adult patients from a large urban healthcare system with encounters between 2018 and 2021. Patients were randomly divided into development (70%) and validation (30%) cohorts. We developed 3 models: a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model predicting ED visit counts, a logistic regression model predicting any ED utilization, and a logistic regression model predicting high utilization (≥4 visits annually). Predictors included demographic, clinical, and comprehensive SDOH variables from structured EHR data, clinical text, and area-level indicators. Model performance was assessed using discrimination and calibration metrics. RESULTS: In the validation cohort, 27.3% of patients had at least one ED visit during the 12-month follow-up period, with 3.6% classified as high utilizers. The ZINB model demonstrated excellent performance for predicting visit counts (Pearson correlation: 0.74, root mean square error: 1.12). The binary classification models showed strong discrimination for predicting any ED use (AUROC 0.83, 95% CI: 0.82-0.84) and high utilization (AUROC 0.92, 95% CI: 0.91-0.93). Housing instability, transportation barriers, and area-level deprivation were among the strongest SDOH predictors across all models. Calibration plots demonstrated good agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive models incorporating SDOH demonstrated strong performance for predicting ED utilization patterns. The ZINB approach effectively captured the zero-inflated, overdispersed distribution characteristic of ED visits. These models can support targeted interventions by identifying patients at risk for ED utilization."

RECENT FINDINGS: Substantial evidence links social determinants including socioeconomic status, neighborhood characteristics, food security, housing stability, and transportation access to hypertension prevalence, control, and cardiovascular outcomes. Prediction models incorporating these factors demonstrate improved ability to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes compared to approaches using only clinical variables. Food insecurity shows particularly strong associations with blood pressure control, with food insecure patients 1.8 times more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension despite appropriate medication therapy. Housing instability similarly demonstrates independent associations with medication adherence and hypertension self-management. Community-level interventions addressing food access, housing support, and transportation barriers have shown promise for reducing disparities, with several demonstration projects achieving 10-15% improvements in hypertension control rates among vulnerable populations. SUMMARY: Social determinants significantly influence hypertension and cardiovascular disease management, suggesting that comprehensive approaches addressing both clinical and social factors will be necessary to meaningfully reduce disparities. Healthcare systems should implement routine screening for social needs and develop partnerships with community organizations to address identified factors."

Objective: This review aims to summarize the use of NLP in mental health research, with a special focus on the types of text datasets and the use of social determinants of health (SDOH) in NLP projects related to mental health. Methods: The search was conducted in September 2024 using a broad search strategy in PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL Complete. All citations were uploaded to Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation) software. The screening and extraction process took place in Covidence with the help of a custom large language model (LLM) module developed by our team. This LLM module was calibrated and tuned to automate many aspects of the review process. Results: The screening process, assisted by the custom LLM, led to the inclusion of 1768 studies in the final review. Most of the reviewed studies (n=665, 42.8%) used clinical data as their primary text dataset, followed by social media datasets (n=523, 33.7%). The United States contributed the highest number of studies (n=568, 36.6%), with depression (n=438, 28.2%) and suicide (n=240, 15.5%) being the most frequently investigated mental health issues. Traditional demographic variables, such as age (n=877, 56.5%) and gender (n=760, 49%), were commonly extracted, while SDOH factors were less frequently reported, with urban or rural status being the most used (n=19, 1.2%). Over half of the citations (n=826, 53.2%) did not provide clear information on dataset accessibility, although a sizable number of studies (n=304, 19.6%) made their datasets publicly available. Conclusions: This scoping review underscores the significant role of clinical notes and social media in NLP-based mental health research. Despite the clear relevance of SDOH to mental health, their underutilization presents a gap in current research. This review can be a starting point for researchers looking for an overview of mental health projects using text data. Shared datasets could be used to place more emphasis on SDOH in future studies."

Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in preprocessing techniques, with particular challenges arising from the integration of variables that differ substantially in their statistical properties, distributions, and missing data mechanisms. We identified several common preprocessing challenges unique to SDOH data integration: handling mixed data types (continuous clinical measurements alongside categorical social factors), addressing differential missingness patterns, managing different temporal resolutions, and balancing algorithm performance with interpretability requirements. The most effective approaches employed domain-specific imputation strategies tailored to SDOH variables, feature representation methods that preserve relationships between related social factors, and validation approaches that explicitly assess performance across diverse demographic groups. These specialized preprocessing techniques were particularly important for chronic disease prediction models, where social determinants often interact complexly with clinical variables over long time horizons. The review provides a framework for selecting appropriate preprocessing approaches based on data characteristics, clinical context, and implementation considerations, with practical recommendations for researchers and practitioners working with integrated clinical-social datasets."
Patient disclosure of social risk factors during clinical encounters: a mixed-methods study of contextual influences and trust factors,"Thompson MJ, Ehrlich A, Adler-Milstein J, Steiner JF, Gritz RM, Reckrey JM, et al.","This mixed-methods study examines factors that influence patient willingness to disclose social risk factors during clinical encounters, highlighting the importance of trust and perceived relevance to care.","The optimal methodological approach appears to depend significantly on the intended application of the segmentation results, with unsupervised approaches better suited for exploratory analysis while supervised approaches excel when targeting specific intervention programs.","Thompson MJ, Ehrlich A, Adler-Milstein J, Steiner JF, Gritz RM, Reckrey JM, et al. Patient disclosure of social risk factors during clinical encounters: a mixed-methods study of contextual influences and trust factors.

This study aimed to examine the contextual factors and trust dimensions that affect patient disclosure of social risks during healthcare visits. Methods: We conducted a sequential exploratory mixed-methods study. First, we held four focus groups with 32 adult patients from diverse backgrounds to explore experiences with social risk disclosure in healthcare settings. Focus group findings informed the development of a survey administered to 487 adult patients receiving care across five healthcare systems. We used descriptive statistics to analyze survey responses and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with disclosure comfort. Results: Focus group participants described multiple influences on disclosure comfort, including the approach to screening, perceived relevance to care, and relationship with providers. Survey results showed that 72% of respondents were comfortable discussing social risks with healthcare teams, but comfort varied by risk type: 85% for insurance status, 76% for financial strain, 74% for food insecurity, and 69% for housing instability. Factors significantly associated with higher disclosure comfort included: perceiving that screening was directly relevant to care (adjusted OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.13-5.49), having established trust with providers (adjusted OR: 2.86, 95% CI: 1.68-4.87), and confidence in the healthcare system's ability to provide assistance (adjusted OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.42-3.78). Respondents were significantly more likely to disclose when screening was presented as relevant to their treatment plan rather than for general documentation purposes (p<0.001). Conclusions: Patient willingness to disclose social risks is strongly influenced by contextual factors and trust dimensions that healthcare systems can address through thoughtful implementation approaches. Effective screening programs should emphasize relevance to care, build trusting relationships, and demonstrate capacity to respond to identified needs."

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) approach to identify community-level SDOH documented in clinical notes and explore geographic patterns of identified SDOH. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from a large health system with 26 hospitals and 180 clinics across Colorado. We developed an NLP system to identify five community-level SDOH domains in clinical notes: economic stability, education access, health care access, neighborhood environment, and social context. We validated the NLP approach against manual chart review and analyzed the geographic distribution of identified SDOH using patient ZIP codes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: NLP performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 score) for identifying SDOH mentions; population-adjusted rates of SDOH mentions by ZIP code; and geographic patterns of SDOH documentation. RESULTS: From 9.4 million clinical notes (1.2 million patients) from 2018-2022, our NLP system identified 163,742 patients (13.6%) with at least one community-level SDOH mention. Validation against 500 manually reviewed notes showed strong performance across all domains (F1 scores: 0.83-0.92). Geographic analysis revealed significant spatial clustering of SDOH mentions, with 3.6-fold variation in documentation rates across Colorado regions. Higher rates of documented SDOH were associated with lower area-level socioeconomic status (r = -0.67, P < .001) and higher social vulnerability indices (r = 0.71, P < .001). The most frequently documented domains were health care access (8.2% of patients) and economic stability (6.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: NLP can effectively identify community-level SDOH from clinical notes, revealing geographic patterns that align with known socioeconomic gradients. This approach enables healthcare systems to better understand and address the social needs of their patient populations at a community level."

Clinical data, including social determinants of health, create a comprehensive view of patient health when combined with imaging findings. However, integrating these diverse data types presents unique computational challenges that standard models struggle to address effectively. We conducted a narrative review of multimodal AI applications in healthcare, focusing on current methodologies for integrating imaging with clinical metadata. We identified four key approaches: sequential, parallel, hybrid, and fusion models. Literature using transformer-based multimodal predictions consistently finds that transformer architectures can integrate diverse data modalities and achieve superior performance compared to unimodal models. We also highlight emerging techniques, such as graph neural networks and multimodal foundation models, which show promise for developing more sophisticated and clinically relevant AI diagnostics. Despite notable progress, challenges remain in data preprocessing, model interpretability, and clinical validation. This review contributes to the evolving understanding of multimodal AI by providing clinicians and researchers with insights into current techniques, emerging trends, and practical considerations for integrating imaging with clinical metadata in healthcare AI applications."

Digital Transformation in Healthcare: Current Status, Challenges, and Future Directions. J Med Internet Res. 2024;26(1):e50413.",10.2196/50413,JMIR Publications,https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e50413,"BACKGROUND: Digital transformation has emerged as a critical strategic priority for healthcare systems globally, with the potential to radically improve efficiency, quality, and accessibility of healthcare services. However, the healthcare sector has historically lagged behind other industries in digital adoption and integration. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to comprehensively examine the current status of digital transformation in healthcare, identify key challenges, and propose future directions for research and implementation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, searching five major databases for literature published between 2015 and 2023. Studies addressing digital transformation strategies, implementation, and outcomes in healthcare settings were included. Data extraction focused on transformation domains, enabling technologies, implementation approaches, reported outcomes, and barriers. RESULTS: The final analysis included 124 studies. Key findings revealed that digital transformation in healthcare encompasses five major domains: clinical care delivery (92.7% of studies), operational efficiency (76.6%), patient engagement (64.5%), workforce transformation (48.4%), and business model innovation (37.1%). Enabling technologies included artificial intelligence/machine learning (83.9%), big data analytics (72.6%), cloud computing (58.9%), and Internet of Things (46.8%). Implementation barriers were categorized as technical (interoperability challenges, data quality issues), organizational (change management, resource constraints), regulatory (privacy concerns, evolving regulations), and cultural (professional resistance, inadequate digital literacy). Organizations with strategic leadership commitment, robust governance structures, and agile implementation approaches reported more successful transformation initiatives. Economic analysis indicated substantial return on investment potential, with the healthcare AI sector specifically experiencing 39.4% compound annual growth rate between 2020-2024. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare digital transformation requires a comprehensive sociotechnical approach addressing not only technological implementation but also organizational structure, workflow redesign, and cultural change. Successful transformation strategies employ a phased approach, prioritize interoperability, develop robust governance frameworks, and build digital capabilities across the workforce. Future research should focus on developing standardized metrics for measuring transformation progress, evaluating the long-term impact on clinical outcomes and health equity, and creating implementation models suited for resource-constrained settings."

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a machine learning model incorporating social determinants of health (SDOH) to predict hospitalization risk and length of stay for older adults with cardiovascular disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 28,463 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with cardiovascular disease who received care within a large health system between 2018 and 2022. Patients were divided into development (80%) and validation (20%) cohorts. EXPOSURES: Comprehensive SDOH assessment including transportation access, social support, housing stability, food security, health literacy, financial strain, and neighborhood characteristics, alongside traditional clinical and demographic variables. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization within 180 days. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization within 30 days and hospital length of stay. We compared machine learning models with and without SDOH variables using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and calibration metrics. RESULTS: Among 28,463 patients (mean [SD] age, 76.4 [7.8] years; 15,088 [53.0%] female), 6,251 (22.0%) were hospitalized within 180 days. The primary machine learning model incorporating SDOH variables achieved an AUROC of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72-0.76) for predicting 180-day hospitalization, significantly outperforming the model without SDOH variables (AUROC, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.66-0.70; P < .001). The most important predictors included transportation barriers (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% CI, 1.71-2.09), social isolation (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.56-1.92), and housing instability (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.51-1.87). Similar improvements were observed for 30-day hospitalization prediction (AUROC, 0.76 vs 0.70; P < .001). The SDOH-enhanced model also better predicted hospital length of stay (mean absolute error, 1.86 vs 2.54 days; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Integration of SDOH variables significantly improved the predictive performance of hospitalization risk models for older adults with cardiovascular disease. These findings highlight the importance of systematically assessing social factors in clinical settings and incorporating them into risk prediction frameworks."
