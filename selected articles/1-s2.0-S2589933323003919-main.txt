BACKGROUND: Individual adverse social determinants of health are
associated with increased risk of diabetes in pregnancy, but the relativeinﬂuence of neighborhood or community-level social determinants of
health is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether living in neighbor-
hoods with greater socioeconomic disadvantage, food deserts, or lesswalkability was associated with having pregestational diabetes and devel-oping gestational diabetes.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a secondary analysis of the prospec-
tive Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-To-Be.Home addresses in the ﬁrst trimester were geocoded at the census tract
level. The exposures (modeled separately) were the following 3 neighbor-
hood-level measures of adverse social determinants of health: (1) socio-economic disadvantage, de ﬁned by the Area Deprivation Index and
measured in tertiles from the lowest tertile (ie, least disadvantage [T1]) tothe highest (ie, most disadvantage [T3]); (2) food desert, de ﬁned by the
United States Department of Agriculture Food Access Research Atlas (yes/no by low income and low access criteria); and (3) less walkability, de ﬁned
by the Environmental Protection Agency National Walkability Index (mostwalkable score [15.26 −20.0] vs less walkable score [ <15.26]). Multino-
mial logistic regression was used to model the odds of gestational diabe-tes or pregestational diabetes relative to no diabetes as the reference,
adjusted for age at delivery, chronic hypertension, Medicaid insurance sta-
tus, and low household income ( <130% of the US poverty level).RESULTS: Among the 9155 assessed individuals, the mean Area Depri-
vation Index score was 39.0 (interquartile range, 19.0 −71.0), 37.0% lived
in a food desert, and 41.0% lived in a less walkable neighborhood. The fre-quency of pregestational and gestational diabetes diagnosis was 1.5% and4.2%, respectively. Individuals living in a community in the highest tertile ofsocioeconomic disadvantage had increased odds of entering pregnancywith pregestational diabetes compared with those in the lowest tertile(T3 vs T1: 2.6% vs 0.8%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.52; 95% con ﬁdence
interval, 1.41 −4.48). Individuals living in a food desert (4.8% vs 4.0%;
adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% con ﬁdence interval, 1.06 −1.77) and in a
less walkable neighborhood (4.4% vs 3.8%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.33;
95% con ﬁdence interval, 1.04 −1.71) had increased odds of gestational
diabetes. There was no signi ﬁcant association between living in a food des-
ert or a less walkable neighborhood and pregestational diabetes, orbetween socioeconomic disadvantage and gestational diabetes.
CONCLUSION: Nulliparous individuals living in a neighborhood with
higher socioeconomic disadvantage were at increased odds of enteringpregnancy with pregestational diabetes, and those living in a food desertor a less walkable neighborhood were at increased odds of developinggestational diabetes, after controlling for known covariates.

Introduction
The revalence of pregestational type
1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)
and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
has nearly doubled in the United Statesover the past 2 decades.
1−4In 2021,
>2% of pregnant individuals were living
with DM, and another 8% developedGDM.
1−3,5Both DM and GDM are asso-
ciated with increased risk of adverse preg-nancy and postpart um cardiometabolic
outcomes for the pregnant individual andchild.
6−9Reducing the risk of DM in
pregnancy and associated adverse out-comes requires addressing both medicalcare and nonmedical social needs.
Individual adverse social determi-
nants of health (SDOH), which includesystemic racism, poverty, housing insta-bility, food and nutrition insecurity, lessaccess to green space, and lack of qualityeducation, health care, transportation,and employment, are associated withhigher risk of adverse pregnancy out-
comes and DM outside of pregnancy.
10
−17SDOH can also be assessed at the
neighborhood or community level,including through the use of measuresthat assess the structural and socialenvironment, such as socioeconomicdisadvantage, food deserts, and walk-
ability.
18−21Individuals living in neigh-
borhoods with greater socioeconomic
disadvantage, food deserts, and less
walkability, experience a higher burdenof proximal SDOH. These neighbor-hood-level measures have been associ-ated with inadequate glycemic controlamong pregnant individuals withDM.
22−24Elucidating the impact of
neighborhood SDOH on the risk of DM
and GDM is important to inform and
facilitate policy and structural interven-tions to improve perinatal health.

The objective of the current analysis
was to determine whether living in aneighborhood that had greater socio-economic disadvantage, was a food des-ert, or had less walkability was
associated with changes in the rate ofCite this article as: Field C, Grobman WA, Yee LM, et al.

living with DM and acquisition of GDM
during pregnancy. We hypothesizedthat greater exposure to neighborhood-level adverse SDOH across multiple
dimensions would increase the risk of
DM and the development of GDM.
Materials and Methods
Study setting and participants
This study is a secondary analysis of theNulliparous Pregnancy OutcomesStudy: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be(nuMoM2b) prospective cohort that
assessed the contribution of maternal
and environmental factors to adversepregnancy outcomes (ClinicalTrials.govidenti ﬁer NCT01322529).
27Data were
prospectively collected between October2010 and September 2013 at 8 US medi-cal centers. The nuMoM2b study wasapproved by each site ’s institutional
review board, and participants provided
written informed consent.
Nulliparous individuals were enrolled
in the study if they ful ﬁlled the follow-
ing inclusion criteria: no previous deliv-ery at ≥20 weeks ’gestation, a viable
singleton pregnancy with estimated ges-tational age from 6 to 13 weeks, and
intention to deliver at a participating
hospital. Exclusion criteria includedthose aged <13 years, a history of ≥3
pregnancy losses, donor oocytepregnancy, planned pregnancy termina-
tion, fetal malformations likely to belethal, fetal aneuploidy, previous enroll-ment in the study, and an inability to
provide informed consent. Individuals
were excluded from the current analysisif they did not have a residential addressat enrollment that could be geocodedbecause of a geographic location forwhich this metric could not be calcu-lated, such as a post of ﬁce box, a busi-
ness address, or a coastal or offshore
location.
Exposures
The exposures were 3 community-level
measures of adverse SDOH modeledseparately. The primary participanthome address was collected via struc-tured interview at the ﬁrst visit at 6 to
13 weeks ’gestation. Addresses were
previously geocoded using ArcGIS
(www.arcgis.com ; Esri, Redlands, CA),
and then linked at the census-tract levelto calculate the measures of neighbor-hood SDOH.
We assessed socioeconomic disad-
vantage with the 2015 version of theArea Deprivation Index (ADI) available
athttps://www.neighborhoodatlas.medi
cine.wisc.edu/ , which was developed as
a summative measure of severalcommunity-level adverse socialdeterminants to study their effect on
health outcomes within US neighbor-hoods. The ADI draws from 17 US cen-sus indicators across the 4 domains of
income, education, employment, and
housing quality.
18,21,28The measure
generates a composite score that is con-verted to a rank based on a locale ’s
national percentile from 0 to 100. Weanalyzed the ADI in tertiles, from thelowest ADI (least deprivation, tertile 1[T1], reference) to the highest (most
deprivation, tertile 3 [T3]).
29,30
Living in a food desert was de ﬁned
using the Food Access Research Atlas ofthe United States Department of Agri-culture Economic Research Service,which contains a collection of foodaccess indicators by income and meas-ures of supermarket accessibility.
31Liv-
ing in a food desert was de ﬁned as “yes”
or“no”per criteria for both low income
and low access to food.19,32Communi-
ties with low income were de ﬁned as
those in which at least 20% of the popu-lation had a median family income≤80% of the metropolitan area or state
median income. Low community access
to food was de ﬁned as a number of at
least 500 and a proportion of at least33% of individuals who were located >1
mile (urban) and >10 miles (rural)
away from the nearest food store.
Neighborhood walkability was
assessed using the US EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) National
Walkability Index, which integrates
measures of the built environment thatreﬂect the likelihood of people using
walking as a mode of transportation.The index comprises the following com-ponents: “intersection density ”(higher
intersection density correlates withmore walk trips), “proximity to transit
stops ”(shorter distance to transit stops
correlates with more walk trips),“employment mix ”(more diverse
employment types [retail, of ﬁce, indus-
trial] correlate to more walk trips), and“employment and household mix ”
(more diverse employment types plusmany occupied housing units correlate
with more walk trips). Scores ranged
from 1 to 20, with higher scores repre-senting a higher likelihood of peopleusing walking as a mode ofAJOG MFM at a Glance
Why was this study conducted?
Pregestational diabetes and gestational diabetes are associated with increasedrisk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Such outcomes are also associated withadverse social determinants of health. Whether community- or neighborhood-level measures of adverse social determinants of health are associated with riskof pregestational diabetes and gestational diabetes is uncertain.
Keyﬁndings
Nulliparous individuals living in neighborhoods with greater socioeconomic dis-advantage were more likely to have pregestational diabetes, after adjustment forknown covariates. Those in food deserts or less walkable communities weremore likely to develop gestational diabetes, after the same adjustments.
What does this add to what is known?
This prospective study enhances the understanding of the relative in ﬂuences of
multiple community- and neighborhood-level measures of social determinants
of health on the risk of living with pregestational diabetes during pregnancy or
developing gestational diabetes. These results can inform the development ofstructural interventions aimed at addressing community-level social determi-nants of health to decrease the risk of diabetes in pregnancy.Original Research

Outcomes
The primary outcomes were DM and
GDM assessed separately in comparisonwith absence of either diagnosis (refer-ence). DM status inclusive of type 1 and2 DM was assessed by medical record
abstractors at enrollment and at each
follow-up visit on the basis of arecorded diagnosis of either type 1 ortype 2 DM in the medical record. GDMwas de ﬁned by one of the following glu-
cose tolerance testing (GTT) criteria:(1) fasting 3-hour 100-g GTT with 2abnormal values: fasting ≥95 mg/dL, 1-
hour≥180 mg/dL, 2-hour ≥155 mg/dL,
3-hour ≥140 mg/dL; (2) fasting 2-hour
75-g GTT with 1 abnormal value: fast-ing≥92 mg/dL, 1-hour ≥180 mg/dL, 2-
hour≥153 mg/dL; and (3) nonfasting
50-g GTT ≥200 mg/dL if no fasting 3-
hour or 2-hour GTT was performed. Inaddition to GTT data, record abstrac-
tors documented if a diagnosis of GDM
was made during the course of clinicalcare. If no GTT data were available, theinformation from record abstractionwas used for GDM classi ﬁcation.
Statistical analysis
We compared the frequency of ADI ter-
tiles, community walkability, and living
in food deserts by DM and GDM status,respectively. We descriptively comparedsociodemographic and clinical charac-teristics by the 3 exposure measures andby the outcome using chi-square testsfor categorical variables and Wilcoxonrank-sum tests for continuous variables.
We calculated unadjusted and adjusted
odds ratios (aORs) with 95% con ﬁdence
intervals (CIs). We used multinomiallogistic regression given nonbinary out-comes, having neither DM nor GDM(referent), having DM, or having GDM.Models were adjusted for age at enroll-ment ( <25, 25−30,>30−35, and >35
years), chronic hypertension (yes/no),
and individual-level SDOH includingMedicaid insurance status (yes/no) andhousehold income and size relative tothe US poverty level ( <130%, 130%
−350%, and >350%) based on a
directed acyclic graph ( Appendix Figure
1). We did not adjust for race and eth-
nicity given adjustment for multiple
and more accurate individual SDOH.
Because the relative in ﬂuence of a
community-level metric on DM riskmay vary by self-reported race and eth-nicity, through which processes conse-quent to structural racism may operate,we assessed for effect modi ﬁcation in
the adjusted model with interaction
terms between the exposure (ie, com-munity-level metric) and race and eth-nicity. Imputation for missing data wasperformed using multiple imputationby chained equations (MICE) (n=30imputations), and estimates were com-bined using Rubin ’s rules. All statistical
analyses were performed using Stata,
version 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, CollegeStation, TX) and R statistical software,version 4.2.0 (R Foundation for Statisti-cal Computing, Vienna, Austria). Statis-tical signi ﬁcance was de ﬁned by P<.05.
Results
Among 10,038 enrolled nulliparous
pregnant individuals, we excluded thosewhose address could not be geocoded atenrollment (n=450, 4.4%) and who hadunknown DM status (n=433, 4.3%),resulting in a ﬁnal analytical sample of
9155 (91.2%) individuals ( Appendix
Figure 2 ). Those who were excluded
were more likely to be younger, experi-ence adverse individual-level SDOH,and have chronic comorbid conditions(P<.01 for all) ( Appendix Table 1 ). The
frequency of pregestational DM, butnot GDM, was lower among those whowere included than those who were
excluded (1.4% vs 3.5%; overall P<.05).
The median age was 28 years (inter-
quartile range [IQR], 23.0 −31.0)
(Table 1 ). Over a quarter (27.6%) had
Medicaid health insurance, 13.3% self-identi ﬁed as non-Hispanic Black and
16.5% as Hispanic, 38.2% had some col-lege education or less, and 19.8% had a
household income <130% of the US
poverty level. Over a ﬁfth (22.0%) lived
with obesity, 2.4% had chronic hyper-tension, and 17.4% smoked.The median ADI score was 39.0
(IQR, 19.0 −71.0), 37.0% of individuals
lived in a food desert, and 41.0% livedin a less walkable neighborhood
(Table 1 ). The frequency of DM and
GDM diagnosis was 1.5% and 4.2%,respectively. Individuals living in neigh-borhoods with greater socioeconomicdisadvantage, food deserts, and lesswalkability were more likely to be ofyounger age, experience individualadverse SDOH, report tobacco use, and
live with chronic comorbid conditions
(P<.001 for all) ( Table 1 ).
Individuals living in neighborhoods
in the highest tertile of socioeconomicdisadvantage had >2-fold increased
odds of living with a DM diagnosiscompared with those in the lowest ter-tile (T3 vs T1: 2.6% vs 0.8%; aOR, 2.52;
95% CI, 1.41 −4.48) ( Figure 1 ;Table 2 ).
Neither living in a food desert nor in aless walkable neighborhood was associ-ated with DM.
Individuals who lived in a food desert
(4.8% vs 4.0%; aOR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06−1.77) or in a less walkable neighbor-
hood (4.4% vs 3.8%; aOR, 1.33; 95% CI,
1.04−1.71) had increased odds of GDM
(Figure 2 ;Table 2 ). Living in a neigh-
borhood with greater socioeconomicdisadvantage was not associated withGDM.
Interaction effects between self-
reported race and ethnicity (non-His-panic White, non-Hispanic Black, His-
panic, and non-Hispanic Asian) and
socioeconomic disadvantage ( P=.07),
living in a food desert ( P=.40), and
walkability ( P=.05) were not statistically
signiﬁcant ( P>.05) in the above
adjusted models (data not shown).
Comment
Principal ﬁndings
In this large prospective cohort of nul-
liparous individuals, measures of com-munity-level SDOH in early pregnancywere associated with diagnosis of DMand GDM. Speci ﬁcally, nulliparous
individuals living in a neighborhoodwith greater socioeconomic disadvan-
tage were at increased odds of living
with a diagnosis of DM, although fooddeserts and walkability were not associ-ated with DM. In contrast, those whoOriginal Research

lived in a food desert or a less walkable
neighborhood were at increased odds ofbeing diagnosed with GDM.
Results
These ﬁndings demonstrate the associa-
tions between 3 community-level con-structs of SDOH (including an overallmeasure of socioeconomic disadvantage[ADI] and measures of food insecurityand walkability) and DM risk in preg-nancy. The associations between neigh-
borhood SDOH and DM in pregnancy
were similarly observed across racialand ethnic subgroups, suggesting thatthe impact of these community-leveldisparities similarly affected these sub-groups.
24Community-level metrics of
adverse SDOH have been shown to beassociated with increased risk of adverse
pregnancy outcomes, including the
associations of the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention Social Vulnera-bility Index with preterm birth, andof ADI with postpartum
readmission.
30,34,35Among individuals
with DM, the 3 community-level met-
rics assessed in the current study have
been associated with increased risk ofinadequate glycemic control as mea-sured by hemoglobin A1c in early andlate pregnancy.
22−24,36The association
between neighborhood walkability anddeveloping GDM has not been consis-tently observed.
37,38Studies have dem-
onstrated that living in food deserts is
associated with increased GDM risk,39
and living in a food desert and inneighborhoods with socioeconomic dis-advantage is associated with pharmaco-therapy to achieve glycemic controlwith GDM.
40,41By including 3 commu-
nity-level metrics of SDOH and assess-
ing the relative relationship with both
DM and GDM, the current study pro-vides a comparative understanding ofthe relative in ﬂuences of these measures
on DM risk in pregnancy.Clinical implications
The evaluated community-level meas-ures of SDOH are pub licly available
and can be linked to patient or study
participant data through the censustract. The availability of communitymeasures based on geocoded dataalready in the electronic health record(EHR), provides opportunities forfuture technologies to incoporate geo-coding and calculation of these meas-
ures into the EHR to better guide DM
prevention and treatment in preg-nancy. For example, individuals livingin communities with a high ADI, fooddeserts, or less walkability couldundergo additional SDOH screeningand referral to community-basedresources, such the Special Supple-
mental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)and Medicaid-associated prenatal pro-grams like the Pregnancy MedicalHome.

More broadly, these ﬁndings highlight
the impact of the broader environmenteven before pregnancy on the risk of DMand the need for policies to support vul-
nerable communities (eg, by increasing
access to food, green space, economicopportunities, and walkable and safecommunities). Findings from this studyand others that demonstrate a relation-ship between community-level measuresand adverse health outcomes shouldencourage health care workers to actively
seek out opportunities to collaborate with
policymakers and community planners indecisions related to the social and struc-tural environment in their communities.Research implications
Future research is needed to understandwhether community-level interventionsaimed to improve the built environment
and community-level SDOH can reduce
the risk and severity of DM in preg-nancy. Such interventions may includepolicies designed to increase access tohousing and transportation, publicsafety, neighborhood walkability, or thenumber of stores with healthy foods toaddress food deserts.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of the current analysis includethe study of multiple measures ofcommunity-level SDOH. We also
assessed SDOH prospectively with DMrisk in a large, diverse cohort of preg-nant individuals.
Limitations include that the data are
now over 10 years old, but it is unlikelythat the demonstrated associationswould have changed over time. Theexposure was assessed only once inearly pregnancy and did not account forchanging residential locations, but datasuggest that community-level SDOH
are relatively stable through a 3-year
time frame.

employment is the most in ﬂuential geo-
graphic area. Because of the sample size,we were unable to compare the relative
differences in association between com-
munity-level SDOH and rates of DMfor individuals with type 1 vs type 2DM. Previous studies have demon-strated that increasing neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage, lim-ited walkability, and food deserts aresimilarly associated with inadequate
glycemic control among pregnant indi-
viduals with both type 1 and 2 DM. Inthis analysis, we did not account forclustering of the error term by neigh-borhood.
22−24Clustered standard errors
with clusters de ﬁned by factors such as
geography can be used if there are clus-ters in the population that may not be
apparent in the study sample. Given the
observational design of our study, wewere able to demonstrate an associationbetween various measures of adverseneighborhood-level SDOH and DM inpregnancy, but not a causal relation-
ship. These results may not be general-izable to all pregnant populations or
settings because this study was limited
to nulliparous US individuals who wereenrolled in a prospective cohort in theﬁrst trimester. Pregnant individuals
who initiated prenatal care late and whoexperienced more adverse individualSDOH, such as low educational attain-ment, lack of health insurance, and pov-
erty, were likely underrepresented in
this prospective cohort that enrolledparticipants in the ﬁrst trimester. How-
ever, a lower proportion of individualswho experienced adverse SDOH isunlikely to affect the observed associa-tion between neighborhood SDOH andDM in pregnancy.
Conclusions
Living in a neighborhood with greatersocioeconomic disadvantage increasedthe odds of living with DM. Living in afood desert or a less walkable commu-
nity increased the odds of developingGDM. These ﬁndings underscore the
importance of community-level SDOH
as potentially modi ﬁable risk factors for
DM in pregnancy. &
