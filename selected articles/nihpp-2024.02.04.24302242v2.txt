 Background  
Social determinants of health (SDoH) like socioeconomics and neighborhoods strongly 
influence outcomes, yet standardized SDoH data is lacking in electronic health records 
(EHR), limiting research and care quality.  
 
Methods  
We searched PubMed using keywords “SDOH” and “EHR”,  underwent title/abstract 
and full -text screening. Included records were analyzed under five domains: 1) SDoH 
screening and assessment approaches, 2) SDoH data collection and documentation, 3) 
Use of natu ral language processing (NLP) for extracting SDoH, 4) SDoH data and 
health outcomes, and 5) SDoH -driven interventions.  
 
Results  
We identified 685 articles, of which 324 underwent full review. Key findings include 
tailored screening instruments implemented across settings, census and claims data 
linkage providing contextual SDoH profiles, rule -based and neural network systems 
extrac ting SDoH from notes using NLP, connections found between SDoH data and 
healthcare utilization/chronic disease control, and integrated care management 
programs executed. However, considerable variability persists across data sources, 
tools, and outcomes.

 Despite progress identifying patient social needs, further development of standards, 
predictive models, and coordinated interventions is critical to fulfill the potential of 
SDoH -EHR integration. Additional database searches could strengthen this scoping 
review. Ultimately widespread capture, analysis, and translation of multidimensional 
SDoH data into clinical care is essential for promoting health equity.

 Introduction  
The concept of social determinants of health (SDoH) acknowledges that health is not 
simply a product of biological factors or access to medical care, but is profoundly 
influenced by the social, economic, and physical conditions that shape people's lives [1]. 
Research across disciplines including public health, sociology, economics, and 
medicine provides clear evidence that circumstances in the environments where people 
exist have a fundamental impact on shaping patterns of health and well -being [2]. The 
World Health Organization defines SDoH as “ the conditions in which people are born, 
grow, live, work, and age, along with the wider set of forces and systems shaping the 
conditions of daily life”  [3]. These determinants are broadly categorized into five 
interdependent domains that form the structural and social hierarchies in society: 
economic stability, neighborhood and built environment, health care access, 
education access and quality, and social and community context  [4,5]

 Specifically, adverse SDoH like poverty, unequal access to education, lack of public 
resources in neighborhoods, high crime rates, racial segregation, and pollution have all 
been extensively linked to higher rates of morbidity, mortality, and health risk b ehaviors 
across populations [1]. On the other hand, protective and promoting SDoH like higher 
household income, safe green spaces, strong social support, affordable nutrition 
options, and accessible transportation demonstrate significant associations with positive 
health indicators, fro m self -rated health status to reduced prevalence of diabetes to 
longer life expectancy.  
 
Health outcomes are significantly influenced by more than just clinical encounters; 
indeed, research suggests that only about 20% of a person's health outcomes can be 
attributed to clinical care [6,7]. The majority is determined by a combination of individual 
behaviors and various external factors that are collectively referred to as SDoH. These 
“causes of the causes” of health, or upstream social determinants, are estimated to 
account for up to 55% of  population health variation in high -income countries, though 
some models suggest they may account for as much as 70 -80% [7]. Aspects of physical 
environment, socioeconomic status, race, and gender contribute to systemic inequities 
that become embodied as adverse outcomes. This makes social determinants 
fundamental considerations for achieving health equity and overarching popu lation 
health improvement [1].

increase educational attainment, and improve access to care - aligning with several  .

 SDoH domains [8]. The "Improving Social Determinants of Health Act of 2021" [5] further 
legislates Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [9]. 
SDoH -driven Translational Research: Deriving and Translating Health Data 
to Actionable Knowledge into Clinical Care  
 
Incorporating SDoH into clinical practice is essential for achieving health equity, yet 
these determinants are seldom consistently recorded or collected within or outside of 
electronic health records (EHRs). This lack of information is problematic because 
healthcare professionals can only address SDoH with interventions and programs 
effectively if they are aware of and can access this information.  
 
Given the impact of SDoH on health outcomes and the limitations of existing EHRs and 
documentation practices, public health, care providers, and clinical researchers have 
implemented various approaches to standardize the collection, study, and mobilization  
of knowledge generated from this information into clinical care (see Figure 1 ). SDoH 
data, often collected from the community or public health surveys [10], discrete modules 
within the EHR [11], and patient -reported outcome surveys [12], can be aggregated into 
a unified SDoH repository, supporting targeted research initiatives. This integration 
transforms scattered SDoH data into a structured resource for comprehensive study. 
However, the collection, integration, and utility of this data  remain varied and 
inconsistent across systems. To be useful, this information must be not just integrated, 
but also standardized using SDoH ontology [13], common representations [14], and  .

 value sets [15]. Once integrated and standardized, SDoH information can be studied in 
association with positive and negative patient health outcomes and be connected to 
existing programs to address their needs [16]. Leveraging SDoH data within EHRs can 
activate embedded tools like alerts and flags, guiding interventions like nutrition 
assistance based on hunger scores [17], community health worker referrals for those in 
disadvantaged neighborhoods [18], and creating high -risk patient panels for targeted 
care [19]. Such integration facilitates personalized care management and supports 
health equity through patient -centric technologies like self -scheduling apps [20] and 
digital navigators [21], fostering a learning health system that continuously adapts to 
emerging patient needs and outcomes.

Challenges and Barriers

 Integrating SDoH data into EHRs is essential for enabling better decision -making and 
research to promote health equity, yet significant barriers exist [3,22] . Primarily, data on 
key factors like food insecurity, housing, transportation, social isolation, and financial 
strain are inconsistently and incompletely in structured data fields of the EHR [22,23] . 
Furthermore, healthcare professionals use validated screening tools, but of inconsistent 
types with different data standards, which limits interoperability across systems [24]. On 
many occasions, clinical and administrative workflows do not facilitate routine collection 
and updating of SDoH data over time .[25,26]  
 
From a regulatory standpoint, confidentiality rules combined with patients' mistrust of 
how private information is disclosed and shared prevent SDoH data from being shared 
for extended application [27]. A multi -pronged approach involving policy change, system 
redesign, and community engagement is imperative to fulfill the potential of SDoH [28]. 
 
Preliminary results demonstrated that important SDoH factors such as food insecurity, 
transportation barriers, and unstable housing were commonly discussed in clinical 
encounters across a range of specialties. However, these social needs were rarely 
codifi ed in discrete structured fields. This finding aligns with prior literature suggesting 
substantial gaps in systematic SDoH data capture in EHR systems [29]. While NLP 
approaches may help unlock SDoH data trapped in free -text notes, a more robust data 
collection and integration framework is needed to optimize SDoH data capabilities in 
EHRs.

 Once it is known that a patient is experiencing an SDoH and carries risks of associated 
poor health outcomes, e.g., 30 -day readmission, it is critical for the care providers to 
connect patients to existing programs and services to mitigate the risk by addr essing 
the disparity. However, it can be challenging to know what programs and services are 
available to the patient and whether the patient meets enrollment criteria. Clinical 
decision support systems and other digital health technologies could play a cri tical role 
in determining patient eligibility criteria and bringing service recommendations to care 
providers, e.g., case management or discharge planning teams [30]. 
 
While prior works have reviewed aspects of SDoH data collection, NLP approaches, 
and health impacts separately, a comprehensive overview integrating evidence across 
domains could further knowledge. This scoping review aimed to map the literature 
landscape surrounding SDoH -EHR integration to address several key questions:  
 
1) What standardized tools and workflows currently exist for structured SDoH 
data capture in EHRs?  
2) How are external SDoH data sources linked to patient records to enable 
enriched contextual patient profiles?  
3) What NLP solutions show promise for extracting unstructured SDoH insights 
from clinical notes at scale?  
4) What impacts do harmonized SDoH data elements have on predicting health 
outcomes and targeting interventions?

 By systematically searching evidence related to these questions, this review identifies 
current best practices, remaining gaps, and future directions across the spectrum of 
SDoH data integration. The goal is to advance standardized frameworks for reliably 
collecting multidimensional social data within EHRs and translating derived knowledge 
to improve care delivery and health equity.  
 
Method  
Scoping Literature Review  
To explore the current landscape of integrating SDoH data into EHRs, we conducted a 
scoping literature review. This methodological approach allows for a comprehensive 
overview of a broad field of study, and is particularly suitable for fields that have yet  to 
be comprehensively reviewed or where the literature is large, diverse, and complex.  
Search Strategy  
The literature search was conducted in PubMed on 2023 May 8th, a widely -recognized 
database for biomedical literature. We utilized MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms 
to refine our search, focusing on articles indexed with terms "Electronic Health Record s" 
and "Social Determinants of Health." This combination was chosen to specifically target 
studies that discuss the intersection of EHRs with SDoH (Search strategy see 
Supplement  Table 1 ).  . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a  is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

 Screening and Selection process  
The inclusion process involved an initial title and abstract screening phase to identify 
papers related to SDoH capabilities and EHRs.  
Selected papers were categorized into five non -mutually exclusive, key topics to 
structure our analysis (depicted in Figure 2) : 
● SDoH Screening Tools and Assessments : Papers discussing various tools 
and methodologies for screening SDoH.  
● SDoH Data Collection and Documentation : Studies focusing on how SDoH 
data is collected and documented within EHR systems.  
● Use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for SDoH: Research exploring the 
application of NLP techniques to identify and extract SDoH information from 
unstructured EHR data.  
● Associations between SDoH and Health Outcomes:  Papers examining the 
relationship between SDoH and various health outcomes.  
● SDoH Interventions:  Studies that evaluate the effectiveness of interventions 
aimed at addressing SDoH within healthcare settings.   .

In phase two, junior authors were randomly assigned manuscripts for initial meta -data 
extraction. The full text screening involved detailed examination to confirm studies had 
substantive focus on the screening tools, data harmonization techniques, text ana lytics, 
associations, or interventions sub -topics. Additional irrelevant studies were excluded in 
this stage.  
  
Phase three then consisted of evidence synthesis and conflict resolution by senior 
authors, who double -checked and verified the accuracy and completeness of 
extractions to enhance consistency. Through this additional quality assurance process, 
senior autho rs validated phase one and two results. The PRISMA flow diagram [31] was 
utilized to depict the screening process, detailing the numbers of identified, included and 
excluded studies across the systematic search and screening phases, along with 
reasons for exclusion.

 Results  
In this scoping review, we present the findings of SDoH in the EHR according to 5 
domains of interest.   
Data Collection and synthesis  
The initial PubMed query resulted in 685 articles. Articles were reviewed for inclusion 
based on their titles and abstracts resulting in 415 articles. Of these 415 articles, 324 
articles included full text for qualitative synthesis. The reviewed articles w ere then 
classified according to SDoH in the EHR domains. The majority of articles focused on 
SDoH and health outcomes, SDoH data collection and documentation  followed by 
NLP for SDoH, then SDoH screening tools and assessments . In the following 
sections, w e reviewed the major themes and highlighted works for each of the five 
SDoH in the EHR domains (see Figure 3, percentage see Supplement  Table 2 ).  
 
Aligned with PRISMA guidelines (Tricco [31], the screening process involved an initial 
title/abstract review phase led by author C.L. to categorize papers into one or more of 
the 5 topics. Targeted meta -data extraction was performed by assigned reviewers as 
follows: Screening Assessments (R.Y.), SD oHData Collection (C.L.), NLP Approaches 
(C.L.), and Interventions (X.M.). The SDoH and Outcomes papers were randomly 
assigned to the broader reviewer pool (C.L., R.Y., S.H., D.L.M., U.V., H.K.D.) for meta -
data extraction. Additional irrelevant studies wer e excluded in this second phase (see 
Table 2 for details). The full -text meta -data extraction phase allowed confirmation of 
accurate categorization and extraction, with discrepancies resolved through consensus  .

SDoH Screening Tools  
We included 29 papers (details see Supplement Table 3) incorporating SDoH Screening 
tools into EHRs in our review. The majority of the studies utilized home -grown tools for 
screening SDoH. Some studies [29,32 –34] developed their own questionnaires and 
screening sets, reflecting a trend towards customized tools tailored to specific

 healthcare settings or populations. Vendor -specific tools, like the two -item screening 
tool [35] integrated into Epic SDoH Wheel, were less common, but still present. The 
screened determinants varied, but commonly included factors included housing, food 
insecurity, transportation, and mental health indicators like stress and depression.  
 
Studies targeted a diverse range of populations. For example, children were the focus in 
some studies [32,36] , while adults were the primary subjects in studies [33,37] . Various 
healthcare settings were represented, from primary care clinics [38,39]  to emergency 
departments [40], as well as school -based clinics [34] indicating the widespread 
recognition of the importance of SDoH in different medical environments, underscoring 
the growing acknowledgment of SDoH's relevance across the healthcare spectrum.  
 
Active screening methods, where healthcare providers proactively administered 
questionnaires or interviews, were predominant (n = 2 8) [29,33] . Passive methods like 
the analysis of EHR data [41] were less common, but they represented an emerging 
trend. However, the utilization of EHR data for passive screening suggests an emerging 
trend that could streamline the process in the future. While many studies focused on 
personal health determinants (n = 19), others also assessed structural determinants like 
housing quality and social networks [32,39,42] . Not many studies (n = 8), looked at both 
personal and structural determinants.  
Challenges and Opportunities  
The reviewed studies collectively highlight the challenges in standardizing SDoH 
screening across various contexts but also point towards the potential benefits of such  .

 screenings to patient care. The diversity in approaches, as seen in studies [29,32 –34], 
reflects the complexity of addressing SDoH in clinical practice. However, it also 
demonstrates a concerted effort towards more comprehensive patient care. The 
prevalence of home -grown tools [32,34,39,43]  indicates a trend towards customization, 
tailored to specific patient populations and healthcare settings. This is likely due to the 
unique needs and circumstances of different patient demographics. The variability in 
tools and approaches (e.g., the numbe r of questions in studies [29,44] , and the use of 
paper -based vs. EHR -based tools [33,38]  highlight the challenges in standardizing SDH 
screening. This variability could impact the comparability of data and the scalability of 
successful approaches. Despite the challenges, the focus on SDoH screening illustrates 
a shift towards patient care. Re cognizing and addressing social and behavioral factors 
[34,45]  can lead to more effective healthcare interventions and better health outcomes.  
SDoH Data Collection and Documentation  
In our review, we identified 76 articles  (details see Supplement Table 4) describing 
SDoH data collection and documentation practices. Studies focused on engagement 
with populations and leveraged a variety of technologies to support collection and 
documentation processes. Few studies (n = 9) included interviews of patients and 
clinicians, engagement with communities, focus groups, town ha ll meetings and the like 
[46–54]. Other studies (n = 7) collected SDoH information using paper -based entry, 
iPads/tablets, patient or clinician -facing web portals and other web -based toolkits and 
forms [55–61].

 Several studies made use of publicly available, external data resources to infer 
structural SDoH information for a given population. The most common external SDoH 
data sources linked to EHRs were US census and community survey data (at both 
patient/individ ual and area/neighborhood levels), administrative data/claims records, 
and disease registries. Commonly linked community surveys and systems include the 
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Surve y (NHANES), the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) [62], the 
National Institutes of Health PROMIS® (Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System) [63], the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) [64], the 
Center for Disease Control Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) [65], the 
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Accountable Health Communities’ 
Health -Related Social Needs Screening Tool [66], the National Center for Education 
Statistics, the Uniform Crime Reports, and the American Community Survey [67–70]. 
Longitudinal study data included the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult 
Health (Add Health) [71]. Other administrative data sources included the HCUP 
Nationwide Readmissions Database [72], claims data [73], and Medicaid data 
warehouse [74]. Few studies describe use of disease -specific registries e.g. cancer 
registries such as SEER -CMS, SEER -Medicare, SEER -Medicaid [75]. 
 
Several studies (n = 8) describe methods for inferring structural SDoH using geocoding 
of patient addresses and linking to public census tract data [60,76 –78] to integrate 
information related to neighborhood and community -level characteristics (e.g., SES,  .

 crime incidence, health facility locations) [79] and neighborhood factors (e.g., poverty 
level, education, employment status, etc.) [68,80,81] .  
 
External data provided various socioeconomic factors (income, education, employment, 
poverty level, air quality), neighborhood variables (segregation, safety, walkability), and 
health behaviors (diet, exercise, smoking) [62,76,82 –86]. These complemented and 
expanded the individual -level SDoH data (food/housing security, transportation, 
interpersonal violence, etc.) captured directly in EHRs [25,26,28,46,73,82,84,87 –93]. 
Few studies (n = 3) aimed to integrate EHR, genomic, and public health data to study 
the intersection of lifestyle, genetics, and environmental influences [94–96] 
Challenges and Opportunities  
Although these works highlight the potential for study of personal and structural SDoH, 
there is considerable effort for systematically collecting, linking, and analyzing SDoH 
data from external sources together with EHR data at the community, state, and 
national levels [84,97,98] . Few studies have incorporated the use of common data 
models for improving standardization and interoperability of collected SDoH data [99–
101]. Furthermore, few studies demonstrated how this information could be leveraged to 
connect individuals with SDoH risk factors to social programs.   
NLP in SDoH  
In our review, we iden tified 36 articles  (details see Supplement Table 5). describing NLP 
methods for powering SDoH studies. Many SDoH elements are locked within clinical 
free-text notes requiring NLP for identification, encoding, and extraction to standardized  .

 terminologies such as SNOMED -CT or representations [102] . Few studies focused on 
lexicon development using methods such as lexical associations, word embeddings, 
term similarity, and query expansion. Lexicons and regular expressions have been 
demonstrated to extract SDoH and psychosocial risk factors [103–105], learn distinct 
social risk factors with mappings them to standard vocabularies and code sets including 
ICD-9/10, ICD Z codes, Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and SNOMED -CT. 
Most articles (n = 15) describe rule -based approaches using regular expressions and/or 
hybrid machine learning methods leveraging platforms. Some articles (n = 5) highlighted 
well-known rule -based toolkits and platforms adapted  with lexicons and regular 
expressions for SDoH extraction including Moonstone, Easy  Clinical Information 
Extraction System (EasyCIE), Medical Text Extraction, Reasoning and Mapping System 
(MTERMS), Queriable Patient Inference  Dossier (QPID), and Clinical Event Recognizer 
(CLEVER) [19,106 –109]. Other articles (n = 7) describe rule -based systems paired with 
traditional machine learning approaches i.e., an ensemble, particularly using NLP 
systems such as General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE), Clinical Language 
Annotation,  Modeling, and Processing Toolkit (CLAMP), Extract SDOH from EHRs 
(EASE), Ya le clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES), 
Relative Housing Stability in Electronic Documentation (ReHouSED), and toolkits such 
as spaCy and medspaCy in conjunction with conditional random fields and support 
vector machines [110–113]. In contrast, several investigators have leveraged open -
source NLP toolkits like spaCy and medspaCy without supervised learners to extract 
SDoH variables [114–116]. Other studies (n = 19) have solely leveraged traditional 
supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, support vector machines (SVM),  .

 logistic regression (LR), Naïve Bayes, Adaboost, Random Forest, XGBoost, Bio -
ClinicalBERT, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and bidirectional Long Short -Term 
Memory (BI -LSTM) [16,117 –121] to extract and standardize social and behavioral 
determinants of health (SBDoH), e.g., alcohol abuse, drug use, sexual orientation, 
homelessness,substance use, sexual history, HIV status, drug use, housing status, 
transportation needs, housing insecurity,  food insecurity, financial insecurity, 
employment/income insecurity, insurance insecurity, and poor social support. In more 
recent years, studies (n = 9) have focused on the training and tuning of deep learning 
approaches, primarily transformer -based appr oaches i.e., Bidirectional Encoder 
Representations from Transformers (BERT), RoBERTa, BioClinical -BERT models for 
extracting SBDoHs including relationship status, social status, family history, 
employment status, race/ethnicity, gender, social history, sex ual orientation, diet, 
alcohol, smoking housing insecurity, unemployment, social isolation, and illicit drug 
use—from clinical notes, PubMed, among other specialised texts e.g., LitCOVID [122–
131]. The frequency of papers for SDoH extraction NLP algorithms within EHR systems, 
highlighting the combinations and intersections of utilized methodologies can be found

Challenges and Opportunities  
Although these works highlight the potential for extracting SDoH from texts, several 
challenges remain. Few studies focused on lexicon development, make use of standard 
terminologies for encoding SDoH data, and explore deep extraction and representation 
of SDoH attributes and relationships. Also, many studies focus on extraction and 
encoding SDoH data from a single site and fail to assess the portability of methods to 
new textual data sources beyond clinical notes and PubMed articles such as digital 
technol ogies and chatbots. The introduction of shared datasets like the Social History

 Annotated Corpus (SHAC) dataset is an important step towards demonstrating 
generalizability of NLP -powered, SDoH extraction systems. Emerging generative 
models may also improve upon the state -of-the-art demonstrated by common shared 
task datasets.  
SDoH and Health Outcomes  
In our review, we identified 164 articles  (details see Supplement Table 6). describing 
SDoH and health outcomes. SDoH and health outcome studies examined a wide variety 
of health -related events and outcomes in relation to SDoH factors. A predominant focus 
was on infectious disease outcomes, with 16 studies examining drivers of CO VID-19 
hospitalization, mortality, treatment disparities and differences in positivity rates across 
social groups [132–135]. Another major category included healthcare utilization metrics 
like preventable hospital readmissions (n = 11) [136–145], ED reliance ( n = 16) [146–
168], and telehealth adoption [169] . Beyond infectious outcomes and healthcare 
utilization, studies also assessed chronic disease control across conditions like diabetes 
(n = 11) [170–180], hypertension [173,181,182] , kidney disease [183,184] , and obesity 
(n = 7) [146,175,185 –189], along with risk factors like elevated blood pressure and 
cardiovascular events. Some studies focused on cancer (n = 11) screening, diagnoses, 
treatment disparities and survival outcomes [167,190 –199], while others addressed 
mental health (n = 6) indicators [146–151] ranging from dementia incidence [200]  to 
suicide (n = 2)  risk factors [201,202] . Additional outcomes evaluated included maternal 
morbidity (n = 2) [203,204] , pediatric health metrics ranging from vaccine completion 
rates to epilepsy -related consequences.

 The most common quality measures reported were standardized condition control 
thresholds like HbA1c levels for diabetes control [173,205] , blood pressure (n = 5) levels 
for hypertension control, and established cancer staging guidelines [191] . Some studies 
used validated risk prediction models for outcomes like hospital readmissions (n = 5), 
suicide risk [201]  or mortality (n = 6). Beyond clinical indicators, several studies 
incorporated validated SDoH indexes like the Area Deprivation Index [206,207] , Social 
Deprivation Index [208]  and CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index [209] . In terms of analysis 
approaches, common methods included multivariate regression models like logistic 
regression (n = 13) [159,179,180,192,199,210 –217] and Cox proportional hazards 
models (n = 3) [138,196,212]  to assess adjusted outcome associations with SDoH 
factors. Other advanced techniques leveraged included machine learning algorithms 
[215] , geospatial analysis for clustering [218] , and phenome -wide association studies 
[150]  in select studies.                                                                                                   
SDoH Interventions  
A total of 19 papers  (details see Supplement Table 7). were found that collected 
supplementary SDoH data to support population health intervention initiatives targeting 
hospitals/clinics (n = 10) or communities (including primary care, n = 9) at the meso 
(institution) level. Two articles discussed policy pote ntial and proposed policy reform at 
the macro (system) level [219,220] . The majority of the selected research (n = 16) 
focused on implementing a social and healthcare supportive program to address the 
social needs of the target population. Interventions were implemented in various 
settings for hospital -based initiatives, inc luding post hospital discharge [221]  , the 
emergency department [222] , and clinics specializing in different medical disciplines  .

 [223–227]. On the other hand, community -based initiatives concentrated mainly on 
integrating interventions into primary care services [228–231]. The social and 
healthcare supportive programs included a range of initiatives designed towards 
improving community health. These initiatives encompassed the introduction of new 
healthcare programs [232,233] , health education and coaching [225,232,234] , the 
strengthening of medical -legal partnerships [228] , the enhancement of integrated care 
planning [229,231,235]  and the improvement of patient navigation [222,236,237] . Only a 
few papers have examined the potentials of incorporating the family or social support 
element into their intervention design [223,232,234] . Meanwhile, 4 studies investigated 
the potential for enhancing resource allocation through surveying outcomes. The 
improvement objectives encompassed the allocation of staff and equipment [221] , the 
enhancement of patient navigation [224] , and the transformation of health service 
practices [226,238] . 
 
Health outcomes, such as improvements in health metrics, reductions in disease 
incidence, changes in vital signs, and quality of life, are commonly used as measures to 
determine the feasibility of initiating an intervention (n = 10). Several studies have a lso 
assessed social SDoH in relation to patient satisfaction and acceptability 
[230,235,237,238] . Since most programs were new efforts, it was not possible to 
determine the effectiveness of the intervention in the short term, nor could the potential 
generalizability be assessed. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a  is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

 Discussion  
This scoping review set out to map SDoH -EHR integration literature across five key 
domains: structured data capture tools, external data linkage approaches, NLP -based 
extraction techniques, and applications for outcomes analysis, and health care 
interventi ons. Our discussion synthesized major themes and collective gaps within each 
sphere. Regarding our first aim, predominant tailored screening instruments enable 
assessment but standardization barriers persist. For the second objective, enriching 
patient pro files via claims and census linkage shows promise but systematic 
consolidation is lacking. On research question three, rule -based systems boast 
precision while neural networks improve unstructured element recognition —yet 
reproducibility hurdles remain. Fin ally, concerning predicting outcomes and targeting 
programs, consistent risk evidence conflicts with implementation uncertainty. Across 
objectives, we fulfill vital scoping aims in benchmarking maturation levels and specifying 
needs for advancing framework s. Our cross -domain perspective illuminates such 
interdependencies requiring a “full -stack” approach. Thereby, we strengthen capacity for 
wisely collecting and translating multifaceted social data to guide health equity 
solutions.

 SDoH domains screened included housing instability/insecurity, food insecurity, 
transportation and utility service needs , interpersonal safety/violence, financial resource 
strain, social isolation, health literacy, and education level. Notably, the majority utilized 
home -grown screening instruments developed within their health systems rather than 
relying on standardized va lidated tools. The most commonly referenced standardized 
tools were PRAPARE, the National Academy of Medicine’s recommendations, and the  
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ Accountable Health Communities 
screening tool. Researchers tested these tools across primary care clinics including 
family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, and community 
health cent ers. Some studies also examined screening acceptance in emergency 
departments and inpatient units. While most relied on active screening conducted by 
providers during visits, several studies explored passive methods like paper 
questionnaires or electronic tablets. The instruments largely focused on assessing 
individual -level SDoH rather than community or structural factors. However, a minority 
did attempt to capture measures of both. Across diverse populations and 
implementation strategies, researchers foun d SDoH screening feasible to conduct and 
able to successfully identify unmet social needs amongst patients. Still further research 
remains warranted, particularly regarding optimal referral systems and interventions to 
address identified needs.  
SDoH Data Collection and Documentation  
The current body of research demonstrates that numerous external data sources have 
been linked with electronic health records (EHRs) to enhance the capture of social 
determinants of health (SDoH). The most common linkages have connected individual  .

 and area -level census metrics, community surveys, administrative claims data, and 
disease registries to EHRs. Other integrated sources encompassing geospatial data, 
crime statistics, built environment factors, education data, and proprietary population 
health platforms offer additional context. Qualitative interviews and surveys have also 
supplemented patient SDoH insights not routinely documented in the course of clinical 
care [239] . These external data elements provide critical information surrounding 
socioeconomic position, neighborhood landscape, and health behaviors. By uniting 
individual and ecological variables, researchers can assemble more holistic patient 
profiles to advance  risk stratification, outcomes studies, care coordination, and health 
equity initiatives [27,240] . 
Technical approaches underlying external SDoH data integration with EHRs have 
harnessed geocoding of addresses, aggregation of community measures, and linkage 
based on unique identifiers. While progress has occurred, further research must 
promote systemati c collection, analysis, and application of integrated data sources in 
practice. Key steps for the field center on implementing reliable linkage mechanisms for 
disparate datasets and embedding multidimensional patient social profiles within clinical 
decisio n tools and workflows [26,241,242] . Only through purposeful integration and

 NLP in SDoH  
A range of natural language processing (NLP) approaches have been leveraged to 
identify critical social determinants from unstructured clinical notes. Common methods 
include rule -based systems using expert -curated lexicons and regular expressions as 
well a s supervised machine learning models like convolutional neural networks and 
recurrent neural networks. More advanced studies have also employed contextual 
embedding models such as BERT and achieved promising performance. Both generic 
NLP software libraries  and custom systems tailored to the social and behavioral health 
domains have been implemented. Reported accuracy metrics vary substantially by 
model type and target social determinant, but precision and recall generally exceed 
80% for housing insecurity, occupations, and selected social risks. Simpler models 
boast high precision whereas recent neural networks improve sensitivity in capturing 
key entities from free -text fields. Importantly, these NLP approaches recognize more 
patient social factors than str uctured EHR data alone to enable richer risk assessments 
and interventions.  
 
In tandem with advanced informatics solutions, a range of interventions have been 
tested to address identified social needs and related disparities. These encompass 
social programs like community health initiatives, resource referrals and patient 
navigatio n services, integrated care management models, and group education 
sessions with peer support. Certain studies have allocated supplementary resources 
such as medical staff or equipment to vulnerable groups. At times, system -level policy 
changes are require d to promote health equity. Such initiatives have been executed  .

 across community, clinic, and health system settings - each with their own merits and 
challenges. While many efforts underline promising impact on knowledge, self -efficacy, 
and even select health outcomes, more evidence surrounding sustainability, scalabil ity, 
and implementation barriers is required.  
 
Moving forward, better standardized corpora are needed to develop and evaluate 
reusable NLP systems for social domains. Similarly, integration of validated SDoH 
screening workflows rather than one -off analyses will facilitate routine practice. 
Ontologies, shareable custom systems, and improved linkages to longitudinal outcomes 
can further the field. In tandem, more rigorous assessment of multi -sector SDoH 
interventions and targeting of specific mechanisms of impact will maximize reach across 
at-risk populat ions.  
SDoH and Health Outcomes  
This review provides useful insights into current approaches and gaps in research on 
SDoH and health outcomes. Most studies were retrospective analyses examining links 
between neighborhood disadvantage, food and housing issues, healthcare access 
barriers a nd related problems. They studied connections to healthcare use, chronic 
illness control, and infection diseases. Some assessed mental health, cancer, mortality 
but less so. Neighborhood factors were studied most among social elements, followed 
by individu al/family -level food and housing problems.  
 
COVID -19 has stimulated greater attention to health disparities and social determinants. 
Nearly 20 studies examined links between deprivation, barriers, instability and infection  .

(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted February 6, 2024. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.04.24302242doi: medRxiv preprint 

 rates, severity, and outcomes. Consistently higher COVID -19 risks and deaths among 
minorities, low -income groups, and those with prior conditions underscored existing 
inequitable distribution of social risks. Researchers leveraged diverse data from 
records , census indices, and surveys to quantify the disproportionate pandemic burden 
on disadvantaged groups. Studies also displayed sophisticated applications of 
predictive analytics and machine learning to model dynamics. This crisis has expanded 
SDoH data inf rastructure and methodology while underscoring long -term disparities. 
Assessing pandemic response and recovery across social levels is critical, as 
disruptions threaten to worsen effects on vulnerable groups.  
 
Techniques like regression modeling helped characterize adjusted outcome 
associations. But prediction and more advanced analytics were less common. There is 
some consistent evidence tying greater social deprivation to poorer health across 
conditions. But d ifferences across settings and mixed findings remain. More controlled, 
computational research could better uncover precise interactions. Clearer reporting on 
predictive models applied could also help comparisons to guide health equity solutions.  
 
We see more screening for patient social needs in clinics now. But we still need 
standardized processes and data integration into records for tracking over time. 
Currently observational analyses dominate. Moving forward, translating findings into 
community  initiatives for at -risk groups remains vital.

 Analyzing Real -World Data in healthcare, especially with the integration of SDoH, is 
challenging due to the lack of standardized frameworks and complex nature of SDoH 
data. Developing analytic guidelines is crucial for effectively navigating these 
complexi ties, enabling the extraction of actionable insights that inform healthcare 
decisions and strategies. Such advancements are essential for health outcomes 
research, as they provide a foundation for creating more effective, evidence -based 
interventions and p olicies that consider the broad influences of social factors on health.  
SDoH Interventions  
An intervention in response to health care -related issues may transpire at the micro, 
meso, and macro levels, namely patient care, healthcare institutions, and healthcare 
policy [243–245]. According to the study, SDoH recognition facilitates intervention 
programs more at the meso level, such as primary care and specialist referrals, patient 
navigation services, integrated care management, group education sessions, and 
medical staff or equi pment allocation. A few policy modifications piloted macro -level 
practice transformations. Only about half of the SDoH -navigated programs emphasized 
family/peer support and social connections for individual patients (micro -level) as part of 
the interventio n. 
The majority of interventions had some benefit, but because they only addressed a few 
targets in one health system, their generalizability was restricted. This finding holds true 
in the US, where health delivery systems are fragmented as regional networks.  It also 
demonstrates the challenge of implementing interventions for vulnerable populations 
[246,247] , whose demographics vary across communities on account of cultural and  .

(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted February 6, 2024. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.04.24302242doi: medRxiv preprint 

 geographical factors. It is imperative for healthcare professionals to bear in mind that 
identifying SDoH within a community is the initial stage. Establishing connections 
between individuals who are grappling with health issues and social issues can be 
challenging due to mental or physical difficulties. The process of establishing trust with 
vulnerable individuals is iterative and requires ongoing emotional and material input 
from healthcare professionals in collaboration with community social workers. Bes ides, 
in the formation of a regional support network, stakeholders forge lasting partnerships 
with organizations holding the necessary resources to address challenges identified by 
SDoH (e.g., accommodation, and transportation).  
For more effective intervention, a mature plan with SDoH collection tools embedded in 
an EHR system should be adopted and modified to reflect the composition and needs of 
the population being surveyed. The panel should select the platform for survey 
distribution and storage in order to prevent duplication of effort and data loss and 
ensure the program's sustainability. They should ensure that the data utilized to inform 
interventions is collected directly fr om the population undergoing the intervention. 
Utilizing a pilot survey to pre -test a data collection instrument in line with a co -design 
methodology is suggested [248,249] . Co-designing is a collaborative effort aimed at 
establishing a conduit for vulnerable individuals to develop a more supportive 
environment, thereby mitigating the occurrence of unanticipated obstacles.  
Cross -Cutting Insights  
Despite some progress, barriers like screening variability [250]  , data silos [251] , 
predictive model opacity [252] , and program adoption challenges [246]  restrict reliable,  . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a  is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted February 6, 2024. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.04.24302242doi: medRxiv preprint 

 equitable SDoH data usage. Presently, expertise resides in siloes —screening, linkage, 
extraction, analyses, programs. But real optimization depends on an integrated “full -
stack” approach recognizing interdependencies. For example, incorporating extensive 
SDoH variables strains statistical models in outcomes research, demanding guidance 
on principled variable selection and penalization procedures. Breaking down walls 
between activities could promote a comprehensive platform spanning the spectrum from 
collect ion to application.  
This demands rethinking workflows and breaking down antiquated interdependency 
barriers that isolate screening from risk detection or hinder integrating contextual data 
into real -world utilities [26]. Architectural paradigms promoting modular reuse with 
transparency safeguards can help reconfigure fragmented efforts into an interoperable 
ecosystem better serving those with disproportionate risk. [253]  
 
Since conducting searches, exponential growth in large language models (LLMs) has 
occurred, presenting new opportunities [254,255] . LLM -based extraction and temporal 
reasoning models could facilitate reliable SDoH entity recognition across contexts [254] . 
As research continues, embracing interoperable design principles and controlled 
evaluation around representative datasets, model transparency, and equitable 
outcomes remains vital [252] . 
 
Limitations

 This scoping review faces certain limitations in comprehensively capturing the state of 
SDoH data integration into EHRs. Firstly, while efficient, relying solely on PubMed for 
literature searches and English papers only may introduce selection bias, omitti ng 
potentially relevant research indexed in other databases. Supplementing with sources 
like SCOPUS or Web of Science could have revealed additional insights and 
applications.  
 
Second, due to resource constraints, the metadata extraction from the final set of 
included studies was completed by a single reviewer. Having dual independent 
extraction with consensus meetings is ideal to ensure accuracy and completeness of 
scoping revie w data abstractions. The feasibility and impact of implementing a second 
reader should be evaluated in future updates to strengthen robustness.  
 
Finally, heterogeneity across settings, populations, tools, and outcomes creates 
complexity in evaluating SDoH -EHR integration maturity. Varying implementation 
stages and study designs introduce difficulty benchmarking best practices. The scoping 
methodolo gy prioritized inclusiveness over appraising integration quality, leaving gaps 
in assessing real -world effectiveness. Capturing nuanced, multi -dimensional integration 
processes by diverse healthcare systems persists as a challenge, though framework 
refinem ent helps structure insights.   .

 Conclusion  
Overall, while collecting patient social contexts shows immense potential to rectify 
health disparities, realizing possibilities requires ongoing informatics innovation 
alongside economic investments and policy reforms targeting root societal drivers. This  
review contributes an evidence base for such continued progress in wisely applying 
multidimensional SDoH data to promote health equity.  
 
The integration of SDoH data into healthcare practice holds transformative potential for 
addressing health disparities. Realizing this potential demands continued innovation, 
strategic investment, and policy evolution, guided by the evidence and insights g arnered 
from comprehensive SDoH research.
