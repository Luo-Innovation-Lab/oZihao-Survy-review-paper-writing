ABSTRACT
The enormous burden of diet-related chronic diseases has prompted interest in healthy food prescription programs. Yet, the impact of such
programs remains unclear. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of healthy food prescription programs and evaluate theirimpact on dietary behavior and cardiometabolic parameters by meta-analysis. A systematic search was carried out in Medline, Embase, Scopus,
and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases since their inception to 3 January, 2020 without language restriction. A systematic
search of interventional studies investigating the eﬀect of healthy food prescription on diet quality and/or cardiometabolic risk factors includi ng
BMI,systolic(SBP)anddiastolicbloodpressure(DBP),glycatedhemoglobin(HbA1c),orbloodlipidswascarriedout.Thirteenstudieswereidentiﬁ ed
for inclusion, most of which were quasi-experimental (pre/post) interventions without a control group ( n=9). Pooled estimates revealed a 22%
(95% CI: 12, 32; n=5s t u d i e s , n=1039 participants; I

Introduction
A poor-quality diet is a leading risk factor for noncommu-
nicable diseases worldwide ( 1,2), with 1 of every 5 deaths
acrosstheglobeattributabletoasuboptimaldiet( 3).Further-
more, diet-related diseases including obesity, diabetes, andcardiovascular disease place a tremendous financial burdenon healthcare systems ( 4–6), with costs projected to rise
over the coming decades (7, 8). Food insecurity, defined as
lack of access to nutritionally adequate food, is associatedwith the greater consumption of inexpensive nutrient-poor
foods (9–14), lower intake of fruit and vegetables and otherhealthy foods ( 15,16) ,a n dh i g h e rr i s ko fc a r d i o m e t a b o l i c
diseases. Food insecurity is also linked to lower self-efficacyin managingchronicdiseasesowingto mentalandfinancial
strains, such as high costs of medications and other out-of-pockethealthcareexpenses( 17–20).
B a s e do nt h ec r i t i c a lr o l e so fp o o rd i e tq u a l i t ya n df o o d

(22,23).
Despite the rapidly growing interest in healthy food pre-
scription programs by governments, payers, and healthcareproviders, the impact of such programs on dietary behaviorandcardiometabolicriskfactorshas notbeen systematically
evaluated. Some individual studies have reported increases
in participants’ awareness of healthy dietary behaviors(24,25), with mixed findings for actual dietary behaviors
and/orcardiometabolicriskprofiles( 26–28).Theaimofthe
present work was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysisofinterventionalstudiesthatevaluatedhealthyfood
“prescription” programs to gain insight into study designs,
intervention types, and their effects on participants’ dietary
behaviorandcardiometabolicriskfactors.
Methods
This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO
(CRD42020162553).
Searchstrategy
A systematic literature search up to 3 January, 2020 wasconducted in Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials since their inception
without language restriction using the following searchterms: “fruit” and “vegetable” or “produce” or “food” adj3
“prescription” or “voucher” or “incentive” or “program” and
“bloodpressure”or“weight”or“bodymassindex”or“BMI”or “waist circumference” or “glucose” or “A1c” or “lipid” or
“LDL”or“HDL”or“triglycerides”or“consum ∗”or“intake.”
Reference lists of eligible studies were manually scanned to
identifyadditionalrelevantpublications.

wereeligibleforinclusion.Ourpreliminaryliteraturereview
revealed that patient populations that were often the target
of healthy food prescription programs were those with
type2diabetesmellitus,hypertension,and/orcardiovasculardisease.Wethereforewantedtoassesshowhealthyfoodpre-
scription interventions would impact well-established clini-
cal markers of cardiometabolic disease risk that were mostcommonly reported by studies in the field. Included studies
were either quasi-experimental (pre/post with or without
an external control group) or randomized controlled trials(RCTs).Inaddition,healthyfoodprescriptionprogramshad
to be integrated into the healthcare system, with patients
identified and referred by a healthcare provider or otherallied health staff member (e.g., dietitian). Studies involving
pregnant or breastfeeding women, those investigating only
financial or economic implications, and those only examin-ingpatientknowledgeandattitudes,orethicalconsiderations
were excluded. Observational studies, school-based food
programs and government-led food security programs not
linked to healthcare systems and workers and not adminis-
tered with the primary purpose of tackling health outcomeswere excluded. Qualitative studies that did not measure
changes in dietary behavior or cardiometabolic risk factors
were excluded, as were commentary or opinion pieces. Tworeviewers(SBandeitherKTorDC)independentlyscreened
studies for eligibility and extracted the following data into
prepiloted forms: period of data collection, study locationand setting, study design, inclusion criteria, sample size,
average participant age, proportion of female participants,
duration of follow-up, program details, participation rate,effect size estimates, and data required to calculate variance
of effect estimates (CIs, SEs, or Pvalues). As studies were
conducted in different countries and years, the value of
the reported incentive offered to participants was converted
into a standardized United States Dollar (USD)-equivalent
amount adjusted for inflation to January 2020. We assessed
the quality of RCTs using version 2 of Cochrane’s Risk of
Bias tool (RoB2) ( 29) and nonrandomized studies using
Cochrane’sRiskofBiasinNon-RandomisedStudies-ofInter-
vention(ROBINS-I) tool (30). Disagreementswere resolved
byconsensusorviainvolvementofathirdreviewer(JHYW).The overall certainty of evidence was evaluated using the
GradesofRecommendation,Assessment,Development,and
EvaluationWorkingGroup(GRADE)framework( 31).
Statisticalanalysis

to derive these parameters, the SD was imputed from the

such an approach to the overall results. The I

used to assess the heterogeneity of included studies, withvalues <25%, 25 to 50%, and >50% corresponding to low,
moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively
(36). Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection

Thirty-seven studies were excluded after reviewing the full
texts(23, 28,45–79).Moststudies( n=11)wereconducted
in the USA, 1 was conducted in France, and 1 in the
UK. About half ( n=8) of the recruited participants
experiencing food insecurity, and three-quarters (n =9) of
thepatientshadspecificexistingcardiometabolicconditions
including overweight or obesity, hypertension, or type 2diabetes mellitus. The most common study designs were
pre/postinterventionstudieswithoutacontrolgroup( n=9)
and pre/post intervention study with an externally matched
control group ( n=1 ) ,f o l l o w e db yR C T s( n=3). Most
studies recruited middle-aged to older participants (meanage ranged between 45 and 60 y) and had a median samplesize of 79 (range, nfrom 9 to 687). The median follow-up
duration was 6 mo, and 3 studies had extended follow-upranging from 12 to 18 mo. Amongst the 10 nonrandomizeds t u d i e s ,7w e r ed e e m e dt oh a v es e r i o u sr i s ko fb i a sa n dt h e
remaining 3 were deemed to have critical risk of bias due
to confounding (Supplemental Table 1) .O ft h e3R C T s ,2
were deemed to have high risk of bias whereas the other
was categorized as having some methodological concerns
(Supplemental Table 2) . The primary sources of funding
were academic grants (n =5), not-for-profit organizations
(n=3), government social support programs including
food banks ( n=2), insurance companies ( n=2), and
pharmaceuticalcompanies( n=1).
KeydesignfeaturesoftheinterventionprogramsPrimary care physicians were the exclusive referring health-
care providers in 5 studies; the remaining studies em-
ployed other members of the healthcare team, with orwithout primary care providers, to prescribe healthy food
interventions (Table 2 ). Most studies ( n=9) utilized
food subsidies as the means to provide access to healthy
foods, although the amount subsidized varied widely from
USD 14 to 189 per month, lasting from 1 to 6 mo. Four
studies gave participants varying amounts of food suppliesat no cost. For studies that provided subsidies, participants
were able to redeem vouchers at various locations, most
commonly at local supermarkets or farmers’ markets (n=7), although other studies chose less conventional
settings such as mobile fresh food produce vans or foodpantrieslocatedwithinahealthcarecenter(n =4).Themost
commonly prescribed foods were fruits and/or vegetables(n=10); 3 studies further incorporated other foods
such as whole grains and lean proteins into their list of
redeemable products. In addition to monetary incentives,
most studies incorporated other intervention componentsintotheirprogramssuchasdietaryeducationclasses( n=9).
Completion rate, calculated as the proportion of individualswho agreed to participate in the program and completed
it, ranged from 15 to 100% with a median completion rate
of68%.

where available, are provided in Supplemental Table 3.
When results were pooled across studies, healthy food
prescription programs increased daily combined fruit and
vegetable intake by 22% (95% CI: 12, 32), and fruit intakeby 39% (95% CI: 12, 67), with a similar but nonsignificant
change in vegetable intake of 29% (95% CI: –8, 65) (Figure
2andTable 4). This translated to an increase in combined
fruitandvegetableintakeof0.8servings/d(95%CI:0.2,1.4)
and fruit consumption by 0.6 servings/d (95% CI: 0.3, 0.9),
with a trend towards an increase in vegetable consumptionby 0.5 servings/d (95% CI: −0.0, 1.1) (Table 4 ). There was
no evidence of publication bias by Egger’s and Begg’s testsor by visual inspection of the funnel plots. A high level ofheterogeneitywasobservedforeachoutcome( I
2>50%)but
we were unable to meaningfully explore potential sourcesof heterogeneity due to the limited number of studiesavailable. Excluding the study with imputed SD ( 34), based
onpooledSDofotherstudiesfromthemeta-analyses,hadnosubstantial impact on the overall pooled estimates (data not
shown). The detailed GRADE assessment for each studied
outcomeispresentedin Supplemental Table 4 .Basedonthe
GRADE criteria, the overall certainty of evidence was rated
“moderate” for treatment effect on fruit intake, “very low”
forvegetableintake,and“low”forfruitandvegetableintakecombined.

some studies, the input of the healthcare professional(s) to
the intervention and interaction with the healthcare systemwere not clearly described. Likewise, details of the nutrition
education component of the programs were often not fully
reported.Althoughitispossiblethatnutritioneducationacts
toenhancetheefficacyoffoodsubsidies( 84–86),therewere
insufficient data to tease out the independent or interactive
effect of different components of the healthy food prescrip-
tion interventions on dietary outcomes. Future studies are
needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such programs inenhancingthenutritionalknowledgeofparticipants.
We also identified considerable methodological limita-
tions and variable quality of the healthy food prescriptionstudies. Most were quasi-experimental (nonrandomized)
and did not have a control group, increasing the risk of bias
andchanceofoverestimatedfindings,andprecludingstrongcausalinterpretations.Severalstudiesweresmall,short-term
pilot programs that were not powered to detect clinically
meaningfulchangesindietaryorespeciallycardiometabolicoutcomes,alimitationthatcouldunderestimatethepositive
impacts. These limitations are reflected in the serious or
critical risk of bias identified in the nonrandomized studies
and the high or concerning risk of bias in the randomized
trials, and the moderate to very low strength of evidencefor outcomes as determined by the GRADE assessment.
These evaluations highlight the need for more rigorously
designed and adequately powered RCTs to further evaluatethe impact of healthy food prescription on dietary behavior
and cardiometabolic outcomes. Future studies should also
investigate potential sources of heterogeneity that wereobserved in our pooled estimates. Many of the studies did
not simultaneously assess change in dietary behavior and
cardiometabolic risk factors, making it difficult to ascertainwhether a sufficiently large change in dietary behavior had
occurred to alter the cardiometabolic parameters studied.
Self-reporting of fruit and vegetable intake is subject tosignificantrecallbias(whichcouldoverestimateeffects)and
measurement error (which could underestimate effects). All
studies were conducted in high-income Western nations
(particularly the USA), and therefore findings may not be
applicable to other countries with different medical and so-cialsecuritysystems.Finally,morefoodprescriptionstudies
in different countries with varying healthcare systems and
dietarycontextsareneededtofurtherunderstandtheimpactof food prescription programs on diet and cardiometabolic
health.
The focus of most healthy food prescriptions so far has
been on fruit and vegetables. Other dietary components,including nuts, beans, whole grains, and fish are recognized
as important for cardiometabolic health (87, 88), and the
impact of including these dietary components remains to
be evaluated. Of note, healthy food prescription programs
couldbemoreeffectiveiftheywerecombinedwithpoliciestoaddressotherbarrierstohealthyeatingsuchaslimitedaccess
to food stores, lack of cooking skills, and/or access to high-
quality kitchens ( 80,89–92,93). We note that other “food
is medicine” initiatives such as “medically tailored meal”programsarealsobeingevaluatedandseektoovercomethesefood security barriers by delivering preprepared meals toparticipants ( 76). The impact of “medically tailored meal”
programsondietarybehaviorandcardiometabolicoutcomesalsorequiresfurtherevaluation.
The strengths of our investigation include its compre-
hensive search strategy and standardization of the reportedchangeindietaryandcardiometabolicoutcomesthatenabled
meta-analysis. The moderate to long durations of many of
the included studies were comparable to prior evaluationof community-based nutrition intervention programs ( 94),
and suggest healthy food prescription programs may enablesustained change in dietary behavior. Two-thirds of theindividual studies, including 1 of the randomized trials,
