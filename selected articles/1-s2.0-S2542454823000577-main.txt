The Burden of Chronic Disease
Karen Hacker, MD, MPH
Abstract
Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer have been and continue to be some of the
major causes of worldwide morbidity and mortality. A transition between infectious and non-communicable diseases occurred in the early 1900s as a result of improved public health and has persistedever since. Now, as individuals live longer, the prevalence and cost of chronic disease continue to grow.The estimated cost of chronic disease is expected to reach $47 trillion worldwide by 2030. Individuallifestyle and behaviors and community factors play important roles in the development and managementof chronic diseases. Many of these conditions (diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory diseases) are pre-
ventable, and their leading risk factors are physical inactivity, poor nutrition, tobacco use, and excessive
alcohol. Unfortunately, the investment in prevention remains small compared with treatment, both from alifestyle perspective and a social determinants of health perspective. Given the future trajectory of chronicdisease, innovation in technology and pharmaceuticals with a concomitant investment in prevention willbe required. Our future depends on it.

Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart
disease, stroke, and cancer are someof the major causes of morbidity
and mortality in the United States.
1This has
been true since the early 1900s when therewas an epidemiologic transition from infec-
tious disease to noncommunicable diseases.
2
This transition was partly due to improved
nutrition, sanitation, and other public healthsuccesses and medical technology and innova-tion. Since 1950, heart disease has been theleading cause of death in the United States.
3
Worldwide, this transition has also takenplace, although often at a different pace
depending on the individual country. Today,
chronic noncommunicable disease is the lead-ing cause of death worldwide.
4
In the past several years, COVID-19 and
the diseases of despair, such as overdose, sui-cide, and excessive alcohol use,
5,6have
contributed to a decline in the American life-span. However, chronic diseases remain 8 of
the 10 leading causes of death in the United
States.
6,7Even in the context of COVID-19,
heart disease and cancer accounted for nearly40% of all US deaths in 2022.
6It is also
important to remember that COVID-19 inter-acted extensively with chronic diseases. Thesediseases, such as diabetes and heart disease,were identi ﬁed as major risk factors for severe
morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.
8
Part of the challenge moving forward is the
demographic characteristic shift occurring inthe United States and around the world.Longer lives and lower birth rates have trans-
lated to an increase in the average population
age.
9For example, the average age in the
United States was 29.5 in 1960 and in 2021it was 38.6.
10As the population ages, so does
the prevalence of chronic disease. In addition,many individuals have multiple chronic condi-tions. In 2018, it was estimated that 27% ofadults in the United States had multiple
chronic conditions.
11The cost of chronic dis-
ease to the American medical system is enor-mous, accounting for more than $1 trillionevery year.
12Chronic disease accounts for the
overwhelming percentage of preventable deathsand disabilities in the United States and aroundthe world. According to the World HealthOrganization, 63% of worldwide deaths in
2008 were caused by major preventable dis-
eases (cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronicrespiratory diseases, and diabetes).
13In 2011,
the cost of chronic disease worldwide was esti-mated to reach $47 trillion by 2030.
14
In addition to an older population, there
are numerous risk factors that involveFrom the National Center for

individual behavior and lifestyle and commu-
nity factors that affect the prevention and
management of chronic disease. The leadingrisk factors for preventable chronic diseaseare physical inactivity, poor nutrition, tobaccouse, and excessive alcohol use.
15These ac-
count for more than 50% of preventable dis-ease deaths in the United States, includingthose caused by cancer, chronic respiratory
diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular
disease (CVD).
15However, the worldwide
ﬁnancial contribution to ameliorating these
risk factors, ranging from access to healthyfood and places to exercise to smoking cessa-tion and cancer screening, is minimal. Thepercentage of total national health carespending on public health initiatives in the
United States and comparable countries
ranged from 1.1% to 5.9% in 2018. In theUnited States, it was 2.9%.
16
Heart Disease and StrokeIn 2020, worldwide, an estimated 523 million
people reported some form of CVD, and approx-
imately 19 million deaths were attributable toCVD. This represents w32% of all global deaths
and is an absolute increase of 18.7% from2010.
17,18In the United States in 2021,
934,509 people died of CVD (including heartdisease and stroke, the ﬁrst and ﬁfth leading
causes of death, respectively), a 0.6% increase
when compared with 2020. Figure 1 provides
information on the rates of heart disease deathsfrom 2010-2020 by race and ethnicity and dem-onstrates large disparities.
19Stroke was also one
of the leading causes of death in the United Statesand 162,890 people died of stroke in 2021.Black adults are twice as likely to die of strokeas White adults.
19
Annual CVD costs to the nation averaged
$407.3 billion in 2018-2019, up from $378.0billion in 2017-2018.
18Over time, cardiovascu-
lar health has improved, but during thepandemic, there were slight increases in mortal-ity related to heart disease. It is hard to determineif this was due to shifts in health care access,medication management, or other factors.
20
CancerDespite downward trends in rates ( Figure 2 ),
cancer remains one of the leading causes ofdeath both in the United States and world-
wide. In the United States, cancer is the num-ber 2 cause of death and is responsible for 1 inevery 5 reported deaths, or about 600,000deaths a year.
6Of the leading cancers, the
number 1 cause of cancer deaths remainslung cancer, followed by female breast cancer(Figure 3 ). Rates vary by race and ethnicity.
22
The cost of cancer in the United States was
estimated at more than $180 billion in 2015,with a projected increase to $246 billion by2030.
23Worldwide, cancer is the second lead-
ing cause of death. In 2020, almost 10 milliondeaths were because of cancer.
24The leading
cause of cancer deaths worldwide was lungcancer, followed by colorectal cancer.
25It is
estimated that cancer incidence will rise by
over 40% by 2040.25The total cost of global
cancer is estimated to reach over $25 trillionbetween 2020 and 2050. In particular, 5 can-cers: tracheal, bronchial, and lung; colon andrectal; breast; liver; and leukemia, representalmost half of the global cost.
26
DiabetesDiabetes was responsible for over 103,000deaths in the United States in 2021. It is theeighth leading cause of death.
27In 2019,
over 37 million people in the United Stateshad diabetes. Some 8.5 million adults aged
18 years or older met laboratory criteria for
diabetes but were undiagnosed, and an esti-mated 96 million adults aged 18 years or olderARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS

had prediabetes.27Diabetes is growing in
prevalence in the United States with rates
increasing among adults from 10.3% in2001-2004 to 13.2% in 2017-2020 ( Figure
4).
28Worldwide, about 422 million people
have diabetes and the prevalence has beenincreasing steadily.
29A total of 1.5 million
deaths worldwide are directly attributed todiabetes annually, as reported in 2019.
30Esti-
mates in 2016 suggested that if the trends
continue, more than 700 million adults world-wide could have diabetes by 2025.
31Cost es-
timates for the US health care system, lastassessed in 2017, estimate a cost of $237billion.
32The global health expenditure on
diabetes was estimated at $966 billion in2021 for adults aged 20 to 79 years.
33
Alzheimer Disease and Other Dementias
Alzheimer disease (which accounts for 60%-
70% of dementias)34and other dementias
represent a growing issue in chronic disease(Figure 5 ). Recent data suggest that 1 in 10 peo-
ple over 45 years of age report subjective cogni-
tive decline.35It is estimated that 6.7 million
Americans aged 65 years and older are livingwith Alzheimer disease.
35In 2022, Alzheimer
disease was the 7th leading causes of death.6
In 2023, it is estimated that Alzheimer diseaseand other dementias will cost the nation over$345 billion, and by 2050, cost could rise to
nearly a trillion dollars.
36According to the
World Health Organization, there are currentlymore than 55 million people worldwide withdementia, and every year there are almost 10million new cases.
34In 2019, it was estimated
that the burden of dementia was costing globaleconomy $1.3 trillion.

disproportionately affected people with
chronic diseases. Older age, having a chronicdisease (ie, diabetes, heart disease, cancer,
and obesity), or having some of the risk factors
for chronic disease (smoking and inactivity)put people at elevated risk for severemorbidity and mortality.
8In addition, duringthe pandemic, people stopped or delayed
health care.37Partly, this was because of fear
of contracting COVID-19, but it was also
because of delays and changes in access.

creating what has been called a health debt.38
This resulted in a substantial decrease in pre-
ventive care, such as screening for breast andcervical cancer.
39Long-standing health dispar-
ities were also exacerbated during thepandemic. African Americans, Hispanic orLatino, Native Americans, and people experi-encing poverty bore a disproportionate
burden of COVID-19 morbidity and
mortality.
40
To add to this, COVID-19 affected lifestyle
behaviors including nutrition, alcoholconsumption, and physical activity. Physical
inactivity increased (at least for some of thepopulation), as did alcohol consumption.
41
Studies suggest that childhood obesityincreased during the pandemic.
42Although
the full effect of COVID-19 on individualswith existing chronic diseases is as yet un-known, early evidence suggests that both dia-
betes and heart disease increased during the
pandemic.

after a COVID-19 infection.43It is also
possible that stress and anxiety associated
with the pandemic played a role in lifestylechoices, but early data is not clear.
44-47As
we look to the future, it will be important toregain our losses and enhance preventionefforts.
Supporting Lifestyle Changes and Address-
ing Social Determinants of Health
The major risk factors for all of the aforemen-
tioned chronic diseases are intimately con-nected to lifestyle changes. Healthy eating,physical activity, smoking cessation, andalcohol reduction require individual actionand lifestyle changes. The role of medical pro-fessionals in supporting these lifestylebehavior changes cannot be underestimated
and is an important adjunct to treatment.
48
In addition, ensuring an equitable and respect-
ful approach to care will help mitigate knownhealth disparities and establish trust.
49How-
ever, lifestyle changes also require opportu-nity. In jurisdictions without opportunity,behavioral change is dif ﬁcult. For example,
when you live in a food desert, it is dif ﬁcult
to engage in healthy eating behaviors, and
when there are no safe and easily accessibleplaces to exercise, it is dif ﬁcult to enhance
your physical activity. And, when your eco-nomic circumstances, your distance to healthcare, or your access to transportation get inthe way of lifestyle changes, your road tohealth is uphill. Thus, if we do not address
these factors, often called social determinants
of health (SDOH) or nonmedical factors thatinﬂuence health, individual and population-
based behavioral change is elusive. TheSDOH as de ﬁned by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention are “the nonmedical
factors that in ﬂuence health outcomes. They
are the conditions in which people are born,
grow, work, live and age, and the wider set
of forces and systems shaping the conditionsof daily life. These forces and systems includeeconomic policies and systems, developmentagendas, social norms, social policies, racism,climate change, and political systems. ”
50
Today, there is a movement to address both
the SDOH and individual health-related
needs. With the recognition that one ’s social
needs have a direct effect on health outcomes,the health care system is moving towardscreening for social needs and developing
referral strategies with community partners.
Simultaneously, community coalitions andpublic health and representatives from multi-ple sectors (ie, transportation, housing, andeconomic development), are aligning toaddress population-based SDOH.
The Future and Innovation
The epidemiology of preventable chronic dis-
eases such as cancer, respiratory conditions,
type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke isdeeply affected by shifts and changes in life-style related to diet, smoking, physical activity,and alcohol use. It is evident that these behav-iors also effect the development of Alzheimerdisease and other dementias.
51In addition,
large percentages of individuals are burdened
with multiple chronic conditions, further
complicating health care and health outcomes.As we look to the future to reduce the burdenof chronic disease, we anticipate continuedinnovation. For example, there is an increasingfocus on the self-monitoring of biometricsrelated to physical activity, diet, and bloodpressure. As consumers take their health met-
rics into their own hands through wearable
devices, technology applications, and auto-mated messaging, we expect to see shifts inthe use of health care, interoperability, andhopefully encouraging news in behaviorchange and chronic disease self-management.However, technology is costly, requires acces-sibility, and must be culturally competent. To
date, disparities exist, such as internet access,
insurance coverage, educational awareness,and other contributors. These disparitieswere ampli ﬁed during the pandemic as spe-
ciﬁc populations, such as racial and ethnic
groups, those living in low socioeconomicconditions, and speci ﬁc geographic regions,
were at higher risk for severe COVID-19 out-
comes. To achieve health equity, these innova-
tions must adopt nuanced strategies withhealth equity in mind.
As we look to the future regarding lifestyle
changes, we will be contending with both thechallenges to prevention and the opportunitiesthat technological innovation brings. Simulta-neously, the burgeoning pharmaceutical op-
tions for the treatment of diabetes and
obesity, for example, may make preventionless urgent. After all, why focus onTHE BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASE

environmental changes if treatment is avail-
able? Without prevention, across the world,
we will likely continue to see increases inchronic diseases at younger ages and all theconsequent results of growing morbidity andeconomic consequences. This will also be achallenge to lifestyle medicine given the pub-lic’s appetite for easy ﬁxes. But, as providers
and public health professionals, our efforts
are sorely needed now more than ever. Our
future depends on it.
