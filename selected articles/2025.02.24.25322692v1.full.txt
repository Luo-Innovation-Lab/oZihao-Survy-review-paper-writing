Abstract  
Background:  In the field of medical crowdfunding prediction, traditional statistical methods have long 
been the standard. Machine learning algorithms are popular  because they can model complex 
relationships between variables, capture interactions, and provide more accurate predictions, even when 
input variables are highly correlated.   Furthermore,  previous research has largel y overlooked the 
quantitative assessment of success levels and the selection of key predictors. To address these limitations, 
a novel approach is needed that leverages advanced machine learning techniques .  
Objective:  This study aim ed to address these gaps  by proposing a robust feature engineering approach 
that leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) . The goal was to extract  the success 
determinants using a large language model  for a cancer crowdfunding campaign . Furthermore, this study 
evaluate d the performance of four machine learning algorithms in predicting campaign success  and 
quantitatively assessed  the level of success . 
Method:  We separately analyzed linguistic and social determinants of health features to understand how 
much each factor contributes to a crowdfunding campaign's success . These features were generated using 
a large language model ( GPT-4o). A random forest algorithm  with a permutation technique was used to 
rank the features. We comparatively evaluated the prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of four 
machine learning algorithms, random forest, gradient boosting, logistic, and elastic net,  using a 10 -fold 
cross -validation.  
Results:  Gradient Boosting consistently outperforms the other algorithms in terms of sensitivity 
(consistently around 0.786 to 0.7 98), indicating its superior ability to identify successful crowdfunding  
campaigns  using linguistic and social determinants of health features.  The permutation  importance score 
reveals that  for severe medical conditions, income loss, chemotherapy treatment , clear and effective 
communication, cognitive understanding, family involvement , empathy  and social behaviors  play an 
important role in the success of campaigns.  All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Conclusions:  This study highlights the critical role of linguistic, social, demographic, and medical 
features in predicting the success of cancer crowdfunding campaigns, with risk communication and 
medical severity emerging as key predictors. The study also suggests  the need for more nuanced and 
optimized models  and improved income protection and healthcare policies to reduce reliance on 
crowdfunding for cancer treatment.  
 
                                                                      Introduction  
The cost of ca ncer care in the US is increasing rapidly due to various factors, including technological 
advancements, expensive cutting -edge therapies, and improved access to treatment. Cancer patients and 
their families often face substantial financial consequences suc h as borrowing money, spending less on 
food, going into debt, and/or declaring bankruptcy  1–3. These issues are exacerbated by a lack of medical 
insurance or lack of coverage due to healthcare regulations such as the Affordable Care Act. As a result, 
patients and caregivers are seeking help from other sources to raise funds for medical care  2.  
Crowdfunding has become a signif icant tool for raising money through social media and web -based 
platforms like Indiegogo, Kickstarter, and GoFundMe generating  $34.4 billion in 2015 alone  4–7. Medical 
crowdfunding constitutes a significant portion of these campaigns in the United States due to gaps in 
insurance coverage and the prohibitive costs of medical treatments, such as cancer care, even for those 
with insurance  8,9. Success factors for these campaigns include demographic attributes, racia l background, 
campaign images, and textual features, social media  characteristics, with campaigns for children 
attracting  more donations than those for adults  6,7,9,1 0. In cancer treatment crowdfunding, 65.4% of 
campaigns involve advanced -stage patients, with detailed information about cancer types, treatments, and 
costs leading to higher fundraising success  11–15. Additionally, research has characterized the use of 
crowdfunding to support oncology care needs, examining assoc iations between insurance status and other 
characteristics related to unmet financial obligations 13.   
The field of crowdfunding prediction has primarily relied on traditional statistical methods, such as li near 
and logistic regression, in prior studies. These methods assume that the input variables are independent 
from each other. However, when there are correlations among the input variables, using regression methods 
can lead to larger prediction errors. To  overcome this limitation, researchers  have turned to machine learning 
techniques. Machine learning algorithms have  proven to be effective in analyzing hidden associations 
within large datasets and identifying complex patterns 16,17. As a result, researchers utilized machine All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

learning algorithms to predict the success of crowdfunding campaigns  18–20. This shift in methodology 
allows for better predicti on accuracy and the discovery of more nuanced relationships among the input 
variables.  For instance, machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees 
(DT), and K-nearest neighbor  (KNN) have been utilized to predict the success of projects  18,19,21 –24. 
Additional ly, algorithms such as XgBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Generalized Linear 
Model (GLM) have been used to construct prediction models 25.  
Previous crowdfunding research has demonstrated that machine learning methods can effectively model 
comp lex relationships between variables, capture interactions, and yield more accurate and insightful 
predictions. However, there has been a lack of thorough analysis regarding the selection of predictors and 
campaign success measures. Furthermore, the applica tion of large language models in the crowdfunding 
domain remains relatively unexplored. The only study26 to date has ge nerated insights on medical financial 
hardship patterns and unmet social needs by leveraging generative AI on GoFundMe cancer crowdfunding 
campaigns using logistic regression.  
In this study, we explored the use of large language and machine learning models  to generate and identify 
predictors for successful campaigns. The large language model is particularly helpful in capturing the 
semantic meaning of words and phrases in internet -based texts by using word embeddings and contextual 
embeddings, which were tr ained on large, diverse  texts. GPT-4o 27, developed by OpenAI, is a large 
language model known for its conversational text generation capabilities. We utilized GPT -4o and prompted 
relevant campaign information to extract and analyze linguistic and social determinants of health (SDOH) 
factors. We  also provided a robust feature selection based on the permutation technique for a better 
understanding of the model.  
Our research has three primary objectives:  
1. Leverage large language models like GPT -4o to generate an wide range of features . 
2. Implement a r obust feature selection strategy to explain  the contribution of each feature.  
3. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of campaign success metrics and potential predictors  
leveraging an ensemble approach.  
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use a machine -learning algorithm to establish an 
effective prediction model for GoFundMe cancer crowdfunding campaigns with a robust feature selection 
method.  By integrating innovative machine learning algorithms and feature selection strategies i nto 
crowdfunding research, we not only advance the academic understanding of this domain but also provide 
actionable insights that can be directly applied by policymakers and campaign organizers. These All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

advancements are essential for addressing the growing reliance on crowdfunding in the healthcare sector 
and ensuring that support reaches those who need it most.  
    Methods  
Data  
The data for this study was collected from the GoFundMe crowdfunding platform, which is the world's 
largest platform in terms of both the total amount of funding raised and the total number of active 
campaigns. Founded in 2010, GoFundMe features campaigns for various categories, including medical, 
memorials, emergencies, and charitable causes. The data for this analysis was extracted using a 
combination of API access and web scraping techniques. GoFundMe stores its data in Algolia, a search 
and analytics en gine. We obtained the necessary API Key, Secret Key, and Index name by inspecting the 
network tab on the GoFundMe website. We connected to the Algolia API using a Python program and 
retrieved the data. The API provided access to all records stored in the s pecified index, which we then 
processed and stored for further analysis.  The data consists of 4990  campaigns regarding a patient’s 
oncologic treatment and personal and financial life  that began between  January 3rd , 202 3, and December 
31st, 2023, with funding targets between US$ 800 and US$ 1000,000.  
Success Outcome:  
A campaign can be considered successful if it raises a significant percentage of its goal (e.g., 80% or 
100%). Campaigns that reach or exceed their fundraising goal would be considered highl y successful.   
success ratio, defined as the ratio of funds raised to the campaign goal, was converted to a binary variable 
to evaluate different success thresholds.  
Predictors of Campaign Success:  
Building on previous studies , we identified and added new predictors for success in medical 
crowdfunding campaigns on the GoFundMe site , which  are described below  and listed in Tables  1 and 2 
of the supplementary file .  
Crawled Features:  We collected key campaign data, including launch date, title, description, current 
raised amount, target goal, number of donors, and campaign duration. These details provide insights into 
each campaign’s progress and engagement.  
Linguistic Features:  Language and psychological measures significantly influence crowdfun ding 
success. We utilized the LIWC internal dictionary (Pennebaker et al., 2015) to analyze features such as 
analytical thinking, clout, authenticity, tone, cognition, politeness, empathy, social behavior, lifestyle, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

religion, and temporal aspects (past, p resent, future tense). These linguistic features help understand the 
multifaceted aspects contributing to a campaign's success.  
Demographic and Social Factors:  Demographic information includes the age group and gender of the 
beneficiary or campaigner. We a ssessed various health and social status factors, including cancer site, 
stage, therapy type, diagnosis date, treatment status, and associations with healthcare organizations.  
Emotional States:  The mental and emotional state of individuals was assessed for  stress, anxiety, 
behavioral dysfunctions, chronic diseases, and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). The trust level in 
medical care facilities was also evaluated.  
Employment and Education Factors:  We considered employment status, work disruption, sch ool 
absenteeism, and financial impacts such as income loss and struggles with medical, housing, food, and 
transportation expenses.  
Medical Procedures and Treatment Factors:  This includes laboratory procedures, diagnostic 
procedures, specific cancer treatme nts, preventive procedures, alternative therapies, and mental health 
treatments.  
Normalization:  We applied min -max normalization to variables with large value ranges (target amount, 
raised amount, number of donors, and campaign duration) to minimize their impact on prediction results. 
GPT-4o was used to standardize measures of linguistics  and campaign predictors within 0 to 1.  The 
predictors for social  and demographic identity, as well as medical -related, were  extracted as a binary 
(yes/no) and were dummy -coded . 
Methods:  
OpenAI ( GPT 4o): It is a highly advanced language model capable of generating human -like text. GPT -
4o has been trained on a large corpus of data and is known for its ability to understand context and 
produce coherent and contextually relevant responses . 
Logistic Regression with Elastic Net Regularization : Logistic Regression is a linear model used for 
binary classification problems. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. 
The logistic function (sigmoid function) is used to map predicted values to probabilities. Logistic 
Regression with Elastic Net Regularization  16 combines the properties of both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) 
regularization techniques. This approach adds a penalt y to the model based on the magnitude of the 
coefficients, helping to prevent overfitting and manage multicollinearity among features . It is 
computationally less intensive and faster to train compared to ensemble methods.  However, it assumes a All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

linear relat ionship between the features and the log -odds of the outcome, which may not capture complex 
patterns .  
Random Forest:  Random Forest is an ensemble learning method 17 that constructs multiple decision trees 
during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (for clas sification) or mean prediction 
(for regression) of the individual trees. It improves the model's accuracy and robustness by reducing 
overfitting, which is a common problem with individual decision trees.   
Gradient Boosting : Gradient Boosting is another pow erful ensemble technique28  that builds models 
sequentially. Each new model attempts to correct the errors made by the previous models. Unlike Random 
Forest, which builds trees in parallel, Gradient Boosting builds trees one at a time, where each new tree 
helps to correct the errors of the previous one.  
Feature Importance  Tree-based models, like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting , inherently capture  
interaction terms and non -linear relationships due to their structure. They split the data based on feature 
values, effectively capturi ng interactions and non -linearities without the need for explicit feature 
engineering.  The permutation  technique  is used to calculate the importance of each feature. This method 
shuffles each feature individually and measures the change in the model's perf ormance to determine the 
importance of that feature.  
Experiment al Setup :  
We conducted two sets of comparative experiments based on machine learning algorithms to predict the 
success of crowdfunding projects. We selected campaign and linguistic features as the independent 
variables in the first experiment . In the first experimental setup, w e used a rand om forest algorithm with a 
default parameter setting in Scikit Learn Library in Python for parameter selection to rank  the linguistic 
features  based on their importance or relevance in predicting crowdfunding success measure s. The reason 
for using default parameters is that the grid search parameter optimization technique did not result in 
improved model performance on the training data compared to the default settings.  We used  the 
permu tation importance technique to determine the significance of each feature in a predictive model. 
Unlike traditional feature importance measures in Random Forests, which are based on the reduction in 
impurity (like Gini impurity or entropy) from splits in the trees, permutation importance evaluate s the 
impact of each feature on the model's performance by shuffling its values.  We evaluated  the four learning 
algorithms mentioned above and compared the prediction  performance s. We repeated the same procedure 
on social, demographic, and medical -related features in the second experiment . The data was split into 
training and testing sets of a 70/30 % ratio. All machine learning model performances were validated All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

using 10 -fold cross -validation  on training data.  The testing set was used to val idate our random forest 
model  during feature selection. We used  sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy  for our evaluation metrics.  
Sensitivity was calculated by dividing the number of true positives (campaign success) by the sum of true 
positives and false negatives. Specificity was calculated by dividing the number of true negatives 
(unsuccessful campaigns) by the sum of true negatives and false po sitives.  Accuracy was calculated by 
dividing the sum of true positives and true negatives by the total population.

Descriptive Analysis  
In our analysis, we used a dataset of crowdfunding campaigns to explore their success in relation to their 
progress towards the established goal amounts. The descriptive statistics of the raised amount provide 
valuable insights into the overall distribution and characteristics of the dataset. Among the 4984 
campaigns analyzed, the mean raised amount is $  20016.67 with a median of $  11819.0. Similarly, the 
mean for the goal amount amongst the scraped links is $  40373.73 , and the median is $  25000.00. We 
divided the dataset into five distinct groups by categorizing the data into percentile ranges based on th e 
distribution of a goal amount. Each group is of equal size: ( 799.999 , 10000], (1 0000,2 0000], (2 0000, 
30000], ( 30000, 50000], and ( 50000, 100000 0]. Figures 1 and 2 depict the distribution of the total number 
of campaigners and the total number of donors in each bucket .

Figure 1 presents  an analysis of cro wdfunding campaigns based on goal amounts and their relationship 
with the total number of donors and campaigners.  Higher goal amounts are associated with a significantly 
higher number of donors. Campaigns with goals between $50,000 and $100 0,000 attract the most donors.  
This trend suggests that higher goals may signal more substantial and potentially more impactful projects, 
attracting more backers.  Lower goal amounts ($799.999 to $10,000) have the highest number of

campaigns, indicating that many  campaigners prefer setting lower, more achievable goals.  As the goal 
amount increases, the number of campaigns decreases, suggesting that fewer campaigners aim for higher 
funding targets.  These two figures  provide valuable insights for crowdfunding campai gners. Setting a 
higher goal amount can potentially attract more donors  and maximize success.   
 
Figure2: Distribution of crowdfunding campaigns based on their success ratio  
As the success ratio threshold increases, the proportion of successful campaigns d ecreases, while the 
number of unsuccessful campaigns increases. This trend is expected, as higher thresholds represent more 
ambitious funding goals, which are harder to achieve .

Table  1 presents the performance evaluation of four machine learning (ML) algorithms —Random Forest, 
Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Elastic Net —at a 0.7 success threshold, specifically for 
Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) factors. The reported per formance metrics include accuracy 
(Acc), sensitivity (Sen), and specificity  (Spec) across different subsets of top features (ranging from top 3 
to top 28).   Gradient Boosting consistently outperforms the other algorithms in terms of sensitivity  
(consistent ly around 0.786 to 0.788 ), indicating its superior ability to identify successful crowdfunding 
campaigns. Random Forest offers a balanced performance with good accuracy  (.767 to .769)  and 
specificity  (.831  to .863), making it a reliable choice for predicting crowdfunding success while capturing 
non-linear relationships and interactions.  Logistic Regression and Elastic Net exhibit strong specificity  
(.997  to .999) but poor sensitivity  (.013 to .052) , which suggests they may be overly conservative and  are 
not able  to predict successful campaigns correctly . 
Based on the evaluation  when using Gradient Boosting , selecting the top 3 to 12 features seems optimal. 
The top 3 features provide a strong balance of high accuracy and sensitivity with fewer variabl es, making 
the model simpler and potentially more generalizable. If one aims to maximize model performance with a 
bit more complexity, one can consider using up to the top 12 features, which slightly enhances specificity 
without sacrificing other metrics . All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The results indicate that careful feature selection is crucial for optimizing model performance for 
linguistic features . Gradient Boosting and Random Forest show that selecting around the top 12 features 
provides a strong balance between sensitivity and specificity, making them well -suited for predictive tasks 
in medical crowdfunding. Logistic Regression may require a different approach or fewer features to avoid 
unnecessary complexity, while Elastic Net's performance suggests a moderate feature increase  (up to 18 -
24) could be beneficial. Overall, the findings highlight th e importance of tailored feature selection 
strategies to maximize the effectiveness of machine learning models in this domain.

Gradient Boosting algorithm. Permutation Importan ce score is a metric that indicates how much a 
particular feature contributes to the predictive power of a machine learning model.  The number  of donors 
and goal amount are the most significant predictors of success in the context of this medical 
crowdfunding model.  To improve the visibility of importance scores for the remaining features, we have 
excluded these two variables fr om Figure 4 due to their large variation.  The other features, while related 
to medical and demographic factors, have a much smaller impact on the model's predictive accuracy . 
Based on the chart, The fact that being in the hospital or in unspecified hospice care is highly important 
highlights the severe medical conditions often associated with crowdfunding campaigns. Policymakers 
could use this information to identify areas where the medical system is failing to cover critical care, 
prompt ing discussions on improving hospital funding or hospice services.  The importance of income loss 
suggests that financial hardship due to illness is a key driver of crowdfunding success. This implies that 
patients need better income protection policies or i nsurance solutions to support individuals who face 
financial difficulties due to medical conditions.  The involvement of healthcare organizations as a feature 
suggests that campaigns supported by these organizations migh t have better access to resources  than 
individuals.  The importance of chemotherapy treatment as a feature suggests that crowdfunding 
campaigns associated with this treatment might attract more attention and support, possibly because 
donors recognize the high costs and seriousness of cancer tr eatment . Also, the female patient has a 
successful campaign.

The chart displays the permutation importance scores of various linguistic features related to some aspect 
of behavior or decision -making, possibly in a medical or social context. The features are ranked by their 
importance in predicting an outcome, with higher scores indicating a greater influence on the model's 
performance.  Clear and effective communication, particularly ar ound risk, while also fostering cognitive 
understanding and family involvement. Empathy and social behaviors should be cultivated in professional 
contexts, and positive messaging should be encouraged across various communication channels. Although 
less cri tical, addressing factors like anger, lifestyle, and reward could further enhance outcomes. These 
policy recommendations aim to leverage the most influential factors identified by the model to achieve 
better decision -making and outcomes in the relevant con text.

Principal Results  
In this study, we conducted an empirical analysis of medical crowdfunding. The analysis of 4984 
crowdfunding campaigns revealed key insights int o the relationship between goal amounts, campaign 
success, and donor engagement. Campaigns with higher goals ($50,000 -$100,000) attracted significantly 
more donors, indicating that ambitious targets may signal substantial projects, thus drawing greater 
support. Conversely, lower goal amounts ($799.99 -$10,000) saw the highest number of campaigns, 
suggesting a preference for achievable targets among campaigners. Highly successful campaigns 
exhibited longer durations, averaging over 250 days. We also focused on deriving features using large 
language model  and Feature selection using the Random Forest algorithm . We identified 
"donation_count_full," "goal amount," and "span" as critical predictors of success, with emotional and 
thematic features also con tributing. Among the machine learning models evaluated,  GB demonstrated 
superior performance (range : .786-.788) and True Positive Rate ( range: .693 -.696) , outperforming RF , 
logistic, and EN. The analysis highlights the critical role of linguistic and Socia l Determinants of Health 
(SDOH) predictors in the success of crowdfunding campaigns. Linguistic features such as clear and 
effective communication, particularly regarding risk, along with positive messaging, empathy, and social 
behaviors, significantly inf luence campaign outcomes.  SDOH predictors, including the severity of 
medical conditions (e.g., hospitalization or unspecified hospice care), income loss, and the involvement of 
healthcare organizations, are also key drivers of crowdfunding success. These f indings suggest a need for 
improved hospital funding, better income protection policies, and stronger support from healthcare 
organizations. Additionally, campaigns associated with high -cost treatments like chemotherapy tend to 
attract more attention, unde rscoring the need for targeted support for patients undergoing such treatments.

Limitations  
 This study has several limitations. The study primarily focuses on linguistic, social, demographic, and 
medical -related features. Other factors , such as donor engagement metrics or campaign visibility on social 
media platforms, have  not been evaluated. While cross -validation helps in mitigating overfitting, the 
generalizability of the model to other types of crowdfunding campaigns beyond the specific datas et used 
(e.g., different medical conditions, geographic regions, or platforms) remains uncertain. The model’s 
performance may vary when applied to other datasets, limiting its broader applicability.  The study relies 
on the available dataset for training an d testing . If the dataset is not representative of the broader 
population of cancer crowdfunding campaigns (e.g., biased towards certain demographics, treatment 
types, or socioeconomic groups), the model may not perform well in more diverse or less represe nted 
scenarios . Ultimately, the default parameters we have chosen for Random Forest Feature selection due to  
superior performance than grid-search method may not be applicable or effective for different datasets.  
Comparison  with Previous Studies  
The findings that commu nication around risk, social behaviors , and empathy play  a crucial role in 
influencing donor behavior has been documented in previous study29, where it was found that emotionally 
compelling narratives significantly improve crowdfunding outcomes. Research highlighting the financial 
burden30 of cancer care provides further support for income loss as a significant predictor.  The importance 
of medica l conditions like being in a hospital or receiving chemotherapy treatment is supported by studies 
showing that campaigns related to severe or high -cost treatments, such as advanced -stage cancers, often 
receive more attention and donations31. Our study also sheds light on new insight on medical 
crowdfunding. The analysis introduces the importance of specific linguistic features, such as the use of 
positive language and social behavior indicators, which were not as thoroughly explored in earlier studies.  
For instance, studies like those by  32 recognized the role of narratives but did not delve deeply into 
linguistic content beyond general sentiment.  The involvement of healthcare organizations as a significant 
predictor suggests that campaigns backed by institutions m ight have better access to resources and are 
perceived as more credible.   
Conclusions   
The reliance on crowdfunding for conditions associated with high-importance  features like hospital stays 
and income loss highlights potential gaps in healthcare funding. Policymakers need to assess where these 
gaps exist and consider reforms or additional support mechanisms to reduce the need for crowdfunding in 
critical areas.  The variability in the importance of different features may also point to inequities in access 
to healthcare and financial support. Policymakers can better target support to vulnerable populations  such All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

as those with comorbidities.  A crucial policy objective  is ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their 
medical or financial situation, have equal access to medical care without  crowdfunding .
