In this cohort study, ML models developed in the Get With The Guidelines–Heart Failure
(GWTG-HF) registry using race-specific and race-agnostic approaches were associated with an
improvement in the prediction of in-hospital mortality after hospitalization for HF compared
with the existing and rederived logistic regression models. The addition of SDOH was associated
with an improvement in the performance and prognostic utility of the ML models in Black
patients but not in non-Black patients.
Meaning
The findings indicate that ML models incorporating SDOH may improve risk prediction of in-
hospital mortality after hospitalization for HF, particularly in Black adults.
This cohort study develops and validates a machine learning–based model incorporating social
determinants of health (SDOH) for predicting heart failure mortality.
Abstract
Importance
Traditional models for predicting in-hospital mortality for patients with heart failure (HF) have
used logistic regression and do not account for social determinants of health (SDOH).
Objective
To develop and validate novel machine learning (ML) models for HF mortality that incorporate
SDOH.
Design, Setting, and Participants
This retrospective study used the data from the Get With The Guidelines–Heart Failure (GWTG-
HF) registry to identify HF hospitalizations between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020.
The study included patients with acute decompensated HF who were hospitalized at the GWTG-
HF participating centers during the study period. Data analysis was performed January 6, 2021,
to April 26, 2022. External validation was performed in the hospitalization cohort from the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study between 2005 and 2014.5/11/25, 1:59 PM Machine Learning–Based Models Incorporating Social Determinants of Health vs Traditional Models for Predicting In-Hospital …

Main Outcomes and Measures
Random forest-based ML approaches were used to develop race-specific and race-agnostic
models for predicting in-hospital mortality. Performance was assessed using C index
(discrimination), regression slopes for observed vs predicted mortality rates (calibration), and
decision curves for prognostic utility.
Results
The training data set included 123 634 hospitalized patients with HF who were enrolled in the
GWTG-HF registry (mean [SD] age, 71 [13] years; 58 356 [47.2%] female individuals; 65 278
[52.8%] male individuals. Patients were analyzed in 2 categories: Black (23 453 [19.0%]) and
non-Black (2121 [2.1%] Asian; 91 154 [91.0%] White, and 6906 [6.9%] other race and
ethnicity). The ML models demonstrated excellent performance in the internal testing subset (n 
= 82 420) (C statistic, 0.81 for Black patients and 0.82 for non-Black patients) and in the real-
world–like cohort with less than 50% missingness on covariates (n = 553 506; C statistic, 0.74
for Black patients and 0.75 for non-Black patients). In the external validation cohort (ARIC
registry; n = 1205 Black patients and 2264 non-Black patients), ML models demonstrated high
discrimination and adequate calibration (C statistic, 0.79 and 0.80, respectively). Furthermore,
the performance of the ML models was superior to the traditional GWTG-HF risk score model
(C index, 0.69 for both race groups) and other rederived logistic regression models using race as
a covariate. The performance of the ML models was identical using the race-specific and race-
agnostic approaches in the GWTG-HF and external validation cohorts. In the GWTG-HF cohort,
the addition of zip code–level SDOH parameters to the ML model with clinical covariates only
was associated with better discrimination, prognostic utility (assessed using decision curves),
and model reclassification metrics in Black patients (net reclassification improvement, 0.22
[95% CI, 0.14-0.30]; P < .001) but not in non-Black patients.
Conclusions and Relevance
ML models for HF mortality demonstrated superior performance to the traditional and
rederived logistic regressions models using race as a covariate. The addition of SDOH
parameters improved the prognostic utility of prediction models in Black patients but not non-
Black patients in the GWTG-HF registry.

Heart failure (HF) hospitalization confers a high mortality risk, with in-hospital mortality rates
approaching 5%.1 In-hospital mortality rates vary substantially by race and ethnicity, and there
is a growing need to develop risk-prediction tools to better identify high-risk individuals across
races and ethnicities.2,3
Multiple clinical risk prediction tools are available to estimate in-hospital mortality risk
among individuals hospitalized with HF, including Get With The Guidelines–Heart Failure
(GWTG-HF), Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE), and Organized
Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure
(OPTIMIZE-HF) risk scores.4,5,6 However, most commonly implemented tools for predicting
mortality risk incorporate race as a covariate, assigning a lower risk to Black individuals
compared with individuals of other races. Concerns have been raised about this race-based
approach that assigns lower risk to Black patients and thus potentially raises the threshold
required for risk-based allocation of clinical therapies and adds to the existing disparities in HF
care.7 Moreover, including race solely as a covariate in such risk models may not completely
capture the societal factors contributing to racial disparities in outcomes among patients with
HF. Thus, novel approaches to risk prediction are needed that do not use race as a biological
risk factor and better account for social determinants of health (SDOH) in the risk assessment.
Race-specific risk prediction is one such approach used previously to predict the risk of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and incident HF in community-dwelling
individuals.8,9,10 Race-specific risk-prediction models acknowledge that outcomes are different
between races and look at risk gradients within each race strata, thus allowing for better
capture of unique race-specific risk predictors. The race-agnostic approach to predicting risk is
another strategy that does not consider race as a covariate while developing the risk model in
the overall cohort. Race-agnostic approaches have been recently evaluated to assess biological
parameters, such as kidney function.11,12 In this study, we developed and evaluated race-
specific and race-agnostic models incorporating clinical and SDOH parameters to predict in-
hospital mortality risk among patients hospitalized with HF. We hypothesized that improved
and more equitable risk prediction can be achieved when risk is assessed without race as a
biological covariate and accounts for SDOH. Consistent with our prior approaches, we used the
machine learning (ML)–based random forest technique to develop the race-specific risk-
prediction models.10,13

The present study used data from the American Heart Association (AHA) GWTG-HF registry.
Details of the GWTG-HF program have been reported previously14,15 and are summarized in
the eMethods and eFigure 1 in the Supplement. For the present analysis, 677 140 patients from
634 hospitals between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020, were considered for model
development and validation. A total of 206 054 participants had less than 15% missing data on
relevant covariates, 123 634 (60%) of whom were included in the model training and 82 420
(40%) for internal testing subsets. An additional cohort of 471 086 participants with less than
50% missingness was added to the internal validation cohort to test the performance of the
derived model in a real-world–like data set where patients often have multiple missing model
covariates (n = 553 506). Participating GWTG-HF centers obtained institutional review board
approval and are granted a waiver for informed consent under the common rule. IQVIA
(Parsippany, New Jersey) served as the data collection and coordination center. The American
Heart Association Precision Medicine Platform was used for data analysis.
Candidate Variables
Recorded data in the GWTG-HF registry encompass a range of domains, including patient
demographics, vital signs, socioeconomic status, medical history, laboratory values, cardiac
biomarkers, and electrocardiography and ejection fraction. Details about the candidate
variables used for the risk-prediction model developed are provided in the eMethods and
eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Zip Code– and Hospital-Level SDOH
Among 123 634 participants in the derivation cohort, 64 573 (52.2%) had an admission year of
2015 or later and recorded residential zip codes available to link with publicly available zip
code–level measures of SDOH detailed in eTable 2 and the eMethods in the Supplement. All zip
code–level data on SDOH were for the patients’ residence. Additionally, hospital-level measures
of geography, sole community hospital, essential hospital membership, and disproportionate
share hospital metrics were included as described previously16,17 and in the eMethods in the
Supplement. Race was self-reported in questionnaires with standardized answer choices: Asian,
Black, White, and other.
Study Outcome
Our primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Mortality events were captured as
documented on the case report form for participants in GWTG-HF.5/11/25, 1:59 PM Machine Learning–Based Models Incorporating Social Determinants of Health vs Traditional Models for Predicting In-Hospital …

External Validation Cohort
The performance of derived risk models was assessed in an external validation cohort of
participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study obtained from the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute BioLINCC data repository. Details of the ARIC study
have been previously reported18,19 and are described in the eMethods in the Supplement.
Among 3612 candidate hospitalizations, 3469 patients with HF (1205 among Black patients and
2264 among non-Black patients) were included in the final cohort after excluding participants
who were discharged to hospice (n = 69), left against medical advice (n = 4), or were discharged
on comfort care (n = 70).
Statistical Analysis
Model Development and Metrics for Performance Assessment
Race-specific and race-agnostic models were developed using random forest machine learning
(ML) techniques described previously and detailed in the eMethods in the Supplement. The
race-specific models were developed separately for Black participants and non-Black
participants (subsequently referred to as the race-specific ML model). Variable selection was
performed independently for Black participants and non-Black participants in the training data
set of the GWTG-HF registry as described in the eMethods in the Supplement. The race-agnostic
model was developed in the entire training cohort, excluding race as a candidate covariate from
the variable selection. Multiple metrics were used to assess model performance in the testing
data sets of the GWTG-HF registry and the external validation cohort. Discrimination was
evaluated using the C index with 95% CIs determined using bootstrapping with 2000
replicates.20 Differences in C indices were compared across different models using the DeLong
test.21 Consistent with the recent literature on risk prediction,22,23 calibration was assessed
using the Brier score, representing the mean squared error between the observed and predicted
risk and calibration slopes.24,25 Additionally, a regression slope of the observed mortality rates
was calculated across deciles of predicted mortality rates. A lower Brier score indicates
calibration intercept closer to 0, and calibration slope closer to 1 indicates better performance.
Observed and predicted risks across deciles of predicted risk were also reported in the
validation cohorts as additional measures of model calibration. Reclassification was reported
using categorical net reclassification improvement (at race-specific event rate risk threshold)
and integrated discrimination index.26,27 Decision curve analysis, a measure of the true-
positive cases identified without an increase in the false-positive rate, was used to assess the
clinical net benefit with the model across thresholds of risk.28

The generalizability of the ML models was assessed in cohorts of participants with less than
15% missing data and less than 50% missing data in model covariates. Subgroup analyses were
performed to evaluate the performance of the ML models in age-based (≤70 years or >70 years),
sex-based (male and female), race-based (Asian, White, and other), ethnicity-based (Hispanic
and non-Hispanic), ejection fraction–based (HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction,
using the 50% ejection fraction cutoff), and socioeconomic status–based (median income of
≥$54 471 vs <$54 471) subgroups.
Model Performance in the External Validation Cohort (ARIC Cohort)
We compared the performance of the race-specific and race-agnostic ML models with the
models that used race as a covariate. This included the original GWTG-HF risk score and a
logistic regression model with race as a covariate that was rederived in the GWTG-HF registry
data used in the present study. We also compared the performance of the ML models vs a race-
specific logistic regression model. Details of the logistic regression model are described in the
eMethods in the Supplement. Sensitivity analyses were also performed to evaluate the
performance of an additional ML model with race as a covariate. The importance of race in risk
prediction using the ML model with race as a covariate was assessed using the minimum depth
metric.
Model Performance With the Incorporation of SDOH
To evaluate whether incorporating SDOH might improve risk prediction of race-specific or
race-agnostic ML models, the random forest ML model was rederived using an expanded pool of
covariates that included patient-level clinical data, patient-level insurance status, and zip code–
based SDOH parameters (65 covariates: 38 clinical and 27 SDOH) for patients admitted in 2015
and later and with available zip code–level data. Because participant zip codes were not
available in the ARIC external validation cohort, the clinical and socioeconomic models were
validated only in the GWTG-HF internal validation cohort with less than 50% missingness.
Subgroup analyses were performed by disproportionate share hospital status. Finally, to
determine the proportion of in-hospital mortality associated with specific clinical and
socioeconomic risk factors across races, we used the Greenland-Drescher method for
calculating population-attributable risk percentage as detailed in the eMethods in the
Supplement.29 Analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2 (R Foundation) with a 2-tailed P
value <.05 indicating significance.

The training cohort consisted of 123 634 participants (mean [SD] age, 71 [13] years; 58 356
[47.2%] female individuals and 65 278 [52.8%] male individuals), of whom 2121 (2.1%) were

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of Black participants and non-Black participants in
the GWTG-HF training data set. More Black patients were female; Black patients were also
generally younger; had a higher prevalence of hypertension, obesity, and kidney dysfunction;
and had higher levels of cardiac biomarkers, including natriuretic peptide levels and troponin
(Table 1). Non-Black patients were more likely to have a history of coronary artery disease and
diabetes at presentation. Black patients were more likely to lack health insurance coverage and
had lower median zip code household income.5/11/25, 1:59 PM Machine Learning–Based Models Incorporating Social Determinants of Health vs Traditional Models for Predicting In-Hospital …

Development and Performance of Race-Specific and Race-Agnostic ML Models in
the GWTG-HF Cohort5/11/25, 1:59 PM Machine Learning–Based Models Incorporating Social Determinants of Health vs Traditional Models for Predicting In-Hospital …

The ranked variables for the race-specific and race-agnostic models according to variable
importance are displayed in eFigure 2 in the Supplement. No improvement in C index was
observed with more than 20 covariates in an ML model (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). The
testing subset included 15 634 Black patients and 66 786 non-Black patients (eTable 3 in the
Supplement) with in-hospital event rates of 1.7% (n = 269) and 3.1% (n = 2082), respectively.
Across participants in the Black and non-Black groups, the race-specific ML model
demonstrated excellent discrimination performance (C index among Black patients, 0.81 [95%
CI, 0.79-0.83] and non-Black patients, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.81-0.83]) and adequate calibration
(eTable 4 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). The performance of race-agnostic ML models
among Black patients and non-Black patients was comparable with that observed for race-
specific models (eTable 4 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
In the validation data set with up to 50% missingness in covariates (107 508 Black patients
[19.4%] and 445 998 non-Black patients [80.6%]), the Black and non-Black race-specific ML
models demonstrated high discrimination (C index, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.71-0.77] and 0.75 [95% CI,
0.73-0.78], respectively) and adequate calibration (Brier score, 16 and 31 ×10−3, respectively),
comparable with that noted in the testing subset (eTable 4 and eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
Similar results were also observed with the race-agnostic ML model (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). In subgroup analysis, the race-specific and race-agnostic ML models also
demonstrated good and comparable discrimination and calibration performance across age-
based (≤70 years or >70 years), sex-based, ethnicity-based, ejection fraction, and socioeconomic
status–based subgroups (eTables 5 and 6 in the Supplement).
External Validation of Race-Specific and Race-Agnostic ML Models and Their
Performance vs Models With Race as a Covariate
We externally validated the ML models in a cohort of participants with hospitalization for HF
from the ARIC study (n = 3469; 1205 Black patients [34.7%] and 2264 White patients [65.3%])
(eTable 3 in the Supplement). All non-Black patients self-identified as White. In-hospital
mortality rates were 2.0% (n = 24) and 3.1% (n = 70) for Black patients and White patients,
respectively. Compared with the GWTG-HF cohort, more participants in the ARIC cohort were
female; they were also generally older and had higher rates of cardiovascular disease risk
factors and higher levels of abnormal cardiac biomarkers. Among Black patients, the race-
specific ML models demonstrated superior discrimination (C index = 0.79 [95% CI, 0.77-0.81])
and calibration (Brier, 19 ×10−3) compared with the GWTG-HF risk (C index, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.67-
0.71]; difference, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.07-0.13]), rederived logistic regression with race as a covariate
(C index = 0.71 [95% CI, 0.69-0.72]; difference, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.06-0.11]), and race-specific
logistic regression models (C index = 0.74 [95% CI, 0.72-0.76]; difference, 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-
0.08]) (Table 2; Figure 1; eFigure 6 in the Supplement). A similar pattern of results was5/11/25, 1:59 PM Machine Learning–Based Models Incorporating Social Determinants of Health vs Traditional Models for Predicting In-Hospital …

In reclassification analysis, the race-specific ML model demonstrated improved net
reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination index to the original GWTG-HF
score in Black individuals and non-Black individuals (eTable 7 in the Supplement). In decision
curve analyses, the race-specific ML model detected an additional 3 to 6 mortality events per
1000 Black patients (Figure 2A) and 2 to 9 events per 1000 non-Black patients compared with
other models using race as a covariate (Figure 2B). Performance of the race-agnostic ML model
in the external validation cohort was comparable with that of the race-specific models across
both race groups (Table 2; Figure 2).5/11/25, 1:59 PM Machine Learning–Based Models Incorporating Social Determinants of Health vs Traditional Models for Predicting In-Hospital …

respectively) (Table 2; eTable 7 in the Supplement). Sensitivity analysis comparing the
performance of ML models using a race-specific approach vs race as a covariate demonstrated
comparable C indices among Black patients and non-Black patients. In the ML models with race
as a covariate, race featured in the top 5 predictor variables based on the minimum depth.
Among Black patients in the ARIC validation cohort, the GWTG risk score predicted 5.7% of
patients with an estimated risk above the 5% threshold (eFigure 7 in the Supplement).
Conversely, the race-specific and race-agnostic ML models identified a significantly higher
proportion of patients above the different risk thresholds (5% risk threshold: GWTG score =
5.7%; race-specific ML model = 12.4%; race-agnostic ML model = 15.3%; χ2 P value <.001).
Incorporation of SDOH Into the ML Models
In the GWTG-HF validation cohort, among 13 088 Black patients, the race-specific ML model
that included SDOH demonstrated improved discrimination and calibration (C indices, 0.77
[95% CI, 0.75-0.79]; intercept, −0.07; slope, 0.93) than the models with clinical covariates only
(C indices, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.71-0.75]; intercept, −0.18; slope, 0.85; difference, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-
0.07]) (eFigure 8 in the Supplement). Among reclassification metrics, the addition of SDOH
parameters to the race-specific ML model with clinical covariates was associated with a
significant improvement in upwards reclassification (net reclassification improvement, 0.22
[95% CI, 0.14-0.30]; integrated discrimination index, 0.007 [95% CI, 0.005-0.01]). In the
decision curve analysis, the race-specific ML model with clinical and SDOH covariates (vs
clinical covariates only) detected an additional 3 events per 1000 patients (Figure 2C). Similar
results were observed with the race-agnostic ML model (C index of 0.76 [95% CI, 0.75-0.78];
difference, 0.01 [95% CI, −0.02 to 0.03]). In subgroup analysis, the race-specific and race-
agnostic ML models demonstrated good and comparable discrimination and calibration
performance across disproportionate share hospital–based subgroups (eTable 8 in the
Supplement).
Conversely, among 51 485 non-Black patients, inclusion of SDOH to the race-specific ML models
was not associated with a significant improvement in risk prediction performance with
comparable discrimination (C indices, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.73-0.77]; difference, 0.01 [95% CI, −0.03
to 0.04]), calibration (intercept, −0.39; slope, 0.93), prognostic utility (no additional mortality
events detected by decision curve analysis), and reclassification (net reclassification
improvement, −0.01 [95% CI, −0.05 to 0.03]; integrated discrimination index, 0.003 [95% CI,
−0.002 to 0.006]) (Figure 2D; eFigure 8 in the Supplement). Similar results were observed with
the race-agnostic ML model (C index, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.73-0.76]; difference, 0.005 [95% CI, −0.02

Race-Specific Determinants of In-Hospital Mortality
Using the race-specific ML model among Black patients, multiple SDOH parameters were
identified as strong predictors of in-hospital mortality, with 5 such parameters among the top
20 predictors (Figure 3). Overall, the population-attributable risk percentage for in-hospital
mortality associated with all SDOH parameters was 11.6% among Black patients. In contrast,
among non-Black patients, only 1 SDOH parameter featured in the top 20 risk predictors with a
total population-attributable risk percentage of 0.5% for in-hospital mortality using the race-
specific ML model. Among clinical risk factors, measures of kidney function, blood pressure,
natriuretic peptide, troponin, and age were among the top predictors of in-hospital mortality
across both race groups (Figure 3).5/11/25, 1:59 PM Machine Learning–Based Models Incorporating Social Determinants of Health vs Traditional Models for Predicting In-Hospital …

Discussion
In this cohort study, we developed and validated ML-based race-specific and race-agnostic risk
models to predict in-hospital mortality among individuals with hospitalization for HF. We
observed that the race-specific and race-agnostic ML-based models demonstrated excellent
performance in the testing data sets, including those with substantial missingness in model
covariates. Furthermore, the ML-based models had superior discrimination, calibration, and
clinical utility in the external validation cohort than the original GWTG-HF risk scores and
other rederived logistic regression models using race as a covariate. The addition of zip code–
level SDOH to the ML model was associated with an improvement in risk reclassification and
prognostic utility of the model in Black patients. We also observed significant race-specific
differences in the population-attributable risk of in-hospital mortality associated with the
SDOH with a significantly greater contribution of these parameters to the overall in-hospital
mortality risk in Black patients vs non-Black patients. Overall, the present study demonstrates
the potential utility of ML models for better and more equitable prediction of in-hospital
mortality risk among Black patients and non-Black patients hospitalized for HF.
Novel Approach to Risk Prediction: Role of Machine Learning and Race-Specific
Approach5/11/25, 1:59 PM Machine Learning–Based Models Incorporating Social Determinants of Health vs Traditional Models for Predicting In-Hospital …

The most significant advancement with our risk models is the use of ML-based approach to risk
prediction. Several models exist for predicting the risk of adverse outcomes among patients
with HF hospitalization. Established models, such as the GWTG-HF, OPTIMIZE-HF, ADHERE,
and AHFI (Acute Heart Failure Index) risk scores, use traditional statistical modeling
techniques, provide acceptable risk stratification, and have been well validated in external
cohorts.4,5,30 A summary of prior risk-prediction models is provided in eTable 9 in the
Supplement. Besides traditional risk-prediction models, some previous studies have also
developed ML-based models to predict in-hospital mortality. However, these studies have been
mainly developed in non-US–based, ethnically homogenous cohorts.31 The ML models
developed in the present study offer several advantages. First, they incorporate well-established
prognostic biomarkers for HF in risk prediction not included in previous risk models and are
thus better predicting individual-level risk. Second, the ML-based approach allows for greater
generalizability, better tolerance to missing data, and more accurate risk prediction in external
cohorts. This is evidenced by the ML model demonstrating adequate performance in a cohort
with up to 50% missingness. With the addition of an application programming interface to
improve implementation,10 the ML models offer an opportunity for real-world, electronic
health record–based risk prediction.
In addition to using the ML-based approach to risk prediction, other aspects of our risk models
are noteworthy. In the present study, we developed race-specific models for in-hospital
mortality. We observed superior performance of the race-specific logistic regression model
compared with models using race as a covariate, highlighting the potential utility of race-
specific risk-prediction models. However, when using an ML-based approach, the
discrimination and calibration metrics for the race-specific ML model were comparable with
the ML model using race as a covariate. This is related to the modeling approach used by
random forest learning methods, which assigned race a lower minimal depth (higher
importance). Thus, the random forest model takes a race-specific approach, even when race is
included as a covariate, creating a decision tree after the first few nodes, comparable with a
race-specific model. Furthermore, even with the use of a race-agnostic approach (without race
as a covariate), the performance of the ML model was comparable with the race-specific model.
Taken together, the ML-based approach represents the most novel aspect of our risk model that
is associated with improved and more equitable prediction of individual-level risk across race
groups. Thus, even though the risk of mortality among Black patients was lower than non-Black
patients in our study cohorts, the proportion of Black patients identified to be above specific
risk thresholds was higher with the ML models than with the traditional GWTG-HF model.
Future studies are needed to determine if similar ML models may facilitate more equitable risk-
based allocation of care. This is particularly relevant considering the concerns raised about the
potential unintended effects of assigning lower risk to Black patients using the existing risk
models that use race as a covariate, which may add to existing disparities in HF care.75/11/25, 1:59 PM Machine Learning–Based Models Incorporating Social Determinants of Health vs Traditional Models for Predicting In-Hospital …

Incorporation of SDOH to Improve Risk Prediction
SDOH are stronger predictors of in-hospital mortality in Black patients vs non-Black patients
with HF.32,33,34 Previous studies have observed improved model performance incorporating
SDOH data in the risk prediction equations.35,36,37 In the present study, we observed that zip
code–level SDOH contributed more than 11% of the total in-hospital mortality risk in Black
patients compared with 0.5% in non-Black patients. Consistent with the greater relative
importance of SDOH in predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality in Black patients, we
observed a significant improvement in risk reclassification and calibration with the addition of
these parameters in Black patients but not non-Black patients. Furthermore, the model
performance for the clinical and SDOH model was comparable among patients hospitalized at
disproportionate share vs non–disproportionate share hospitals, highlighting the
generalizability of the risk models among patients hospitalized in low- and high-resource
hospitals.
While the improvement in risk prediction with the incorporation of zip code–level SDOH
parameters is encouraging, future studies are needed to understand better how SDOH factors
can be better incorporated for risk prediction in HF patients. First, it would be more
informative to include individual-level data on SDOH rather than zip code–level data alone.
Second, the ML-based approach used in the present study allowed us to evaluate the clinical
and SDOH model in a data set with up to 50% missingness in clinical parameters. It is plausible
that with better capture of clinical parameters in the model, the relative improvement in model
performance with the incorporation of zip code–level SDOH may be attenuated.
Limitations
Our study has some notable limitations. First, we only included variables that were regularly
captured in the GWTG registry. Data on certain laboratory measures, such as hemoglobin A1c
and lipid profiles, which are associated with increased mortality risk,38 had significant
missingness and were excluded from the candidate covariates. Second, the race-specific models
were developed using self-reported race. Individuals who may not identify with a specific race
on the GWTG-HF data form may not be accurately represented. However, sensitivity analysis
across available races and ethnicities showed similar performance. Third, only zip code–level
SDOH data were available for the present analysis. Incorporating participant-level SDOH
parameters in risk models may further improve their predictive performance. Fourth, race was
self-reported data on genetic ancestry were not available. Fifth, we could not externally
validate the clinical and SDOH models given the lack of zip code data in the ARIC cohort.

The race-specific and race-agnostic ML models to predict in-hospital mortality among patients
with HF demonstrated superior discrimination and calibration in Black patients and non-Black
patients and outperformed traditional logistic regression models with race as a covariate.
Furthermore, incorporating zip code–level SDOH parameters into the risk prediction ML
models improved their performance among Black patients but not non-Black patients. Future
studies are needed to determine whether race-specific and race-agnostic ML models may
improve risk prediction, resource allocation, and care outcomes among Black patients with HF.5/11/25, 1:59 PM Machine Learning–Based Models Incorporating Social Determinants of Health vs Traditional Models for Predicting In-Hospital …
