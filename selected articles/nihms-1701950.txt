Abstract
Background:  Heart failure (HF) risk and the underlying risk factors vary by race. Traditional 
models for HF risk prediction treat race as a covariate in risk prediction and do not account for 
significant parameters such as cardiac biomarkers. Machine learning (ML) may offer advantages 
over traditional modeling techniques to develop race-specific HF risk prediction models and 
elucidate important contributors of HF development across races.
Methods:  We performed a retrospective analysis of four large, community cohort studies (ARIC, 
DHS, JHS, and MESA) with adjudicated HF events. Participants were aged >40 years and free 
of HF at baseline. Race-specific ML models for HF risk prediction were developed in the JHS 
cohort (for Black race-specific model) and White adults from ARIC (for White rate-specific 
model). The models included 39 candidate variables across demographic, anthropometric, medical 
history, laboratory, and electrocardiographic domains. The ML models were externally validated 
and compared with prior established traditional and non-race specific ML models in race-specific 
subgroups of the pooled MESA/DHS cohort and Black participants of ARIC. Harrell’s C-
index and Greenwood-Nam-D’Agostino chi-square tests were used to assess discrimination and 
calibration, respectively.
Results:  The ML models had excellent discrimination in the derivation cohorts for Black 
(N=4,141 in JHS, C-index=0.88) and White (N=7,858 in ARIC, C-index=0.89) participants. In 
the external validation cohorts, the race-specific ML model demonstrated adequate calibration 
and superior discrimination (C-indices=0.80–0.83 [for Black individuals] and 0.82 [for White 
individuals]) compared with established HF risk models or with non-race specific ML models 
derived using race as a covariate. Among the risk factors, natriuretic peptide levels were the 
most important predictor of HF risk across both races, followed by troponin levels in Black 
and EKG-based Cornell voltage in White individuals. Other key predictors of HF risk among 
Black individuals were glycemic parameters and socioeconomic factors. In contrast, prevalent 
cardiovascular (CV) disease and traditional CV risk factors were stronger predictors of HF risk in 
White adults.
Conclusion:  Race-specific and ML-based HF risk models that integrate clinical, laboratory, and 
biomarker data demonstrated superior performance when compared with traditional HF risk and 
non-race specific ML models. This approach identifies distinct race-specific contributors of HF.

INTRODUCTION
Heart failure (HF) affects over 64 million adults worldwide and accounts for nearly 6% of 
total healthcare expenditure in North America and Europe.1, 2 Due to the growing burden of 
cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes and more prolonged survival after 
myocardial infarction (MI) and incident HF, the prevalence is expected to increase.3 The 
lifetime risk of developing HF is 20% to 46% and varies substantially by race.4, 5 Race is 
a social construct and Black adults are more likely to develop HF compared with White 
individuals due in large part to structural racism, social inequality, poor healthcare access, 
and a greater downstream burden of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and 
diabetes.6–8 Additionally, Black adults have a higher prevalence of subclinical phenotypes 
such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and chronic myocardial injury assessed by 
high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), which are associated with higher risk of HF.9 In 
contrast, natriuretic peptide (NP) levels are lower among Black adults, further suggesting 
potential differences in the determinants of HF risk across racial groups.10, 11 After the 
development of HF, prognosis is poor and Black adults appear to have significantly higher 
risk of adverse events, particularly HF hospitalization, compared with other racial groups.12 
Thus, there is a global need for effective approaches to the prevention of HF, but the optimal 
strategies may differ by race.13
Risk stratification tools to identify individuals at higher risk for developing HF are available 
and can help target those at high risk with appropriate preventive strategies.14–19 However, 
most existing HF risk prediction models do not include key prognostic markers such as 
hs-cTn and NP-levels.14, 15, 19 Furthermore, most existing HF risk prediction models, with 
the exception of the recently developed Pooled Cohort Equation to Prevent HF (PCP-HF) 
risk score19, are not race-specific, have been developed in biracial or mixed ethnic cohorts, 
and only incorporate race as a covariate. Self-reported race as a covariate in such risk 
models may not completely capture the social and biological pathways that might predispose 
Black individuals to a higher risk of HF. Additionally, current HF risk prediction tools were 
developed using classical statistical modeling techniques constrained by assumptions such 
as distribution normality, noninformative or random censoring, and hazard risk linearity.20 
Machine learning (ML) methods utilize large, multidimensional data efficiently and may 
improve HF risk prediction.
In the present study, we developed HF risk prediction models in Black and White 
participants separately as a strategy to better elucidate the importance of risk factors that 
may be most relevant to the development of HF across races. Specifically, using ML 
techniques incorporating clinical parameters, including biomarker data, we developed and 
externally validated race-specific risk models to predict the 10-year risk of incident HF in 
Black and White adults. We compared the ML-based race-specific models’ performance to 
the established HF risk prediction models, and non-race specific ML model derived using 
race as a covariate. We further identified the distinct associations of several risk factors and 
clinical characteristics with HF development in Black and White adults.Segar et al. Page 3

METHODS
Requests to access the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), Dallas Heart 
Study (DHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis 
(MESA) datasets can be obtained by the respective study coordinating institutions. Details 
on the software code used in this study are provided in the Supplemental Materials and 
available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
Study population
The present study included individual-level data from four cohort studies: ARIC, DHS, 
JHS, and MESA. The study design, enrollment criteria, participant characteristics, and event 
adjudication for each cohort have been described previously and are discussed briefly in 
the Supplemental Materials.21–25 For the present analysis, the initial (visit 1) phases of 
JHS (2000 – 2004), DHS (2000 – 2002), MESA (2000 – 2004), and visit 4 for the ARIC 
cohort (1996 – 1998) are considered the baseline visits to allow similar follow-up time and 
consistent availability of biomarkers across cohorts. Adults less than 40 years of age or those 
with a history of HF at study baseline were excluded from each cohort (Supplemental Figure 
I).
Race-specific HF risk prediction models were developed in a derivation cohort and 
subsequently externally validated (Figure 1). Data from JHS were used to derive the HF 
risk prediction model for Black participants. The HF risk prediction model for Black adults 
was validated in two separate cohorts of 1) a subset of Black participants from ARIC, 
excluding participants who were also enrolled from Jackson, MS and were included in JHS, 
and 2) a pooled cohort of Black participants from MESA and DHS. The HF risk prediction 
model for White participants was developed using data from ARIC and externally validated 
among White participants from the pooled MESA/DHS dataset. Written informed consent 
was obtained from all study participants, and local institutional review boards approved 
the study protocols. The present analysis was approved by the coordinating centers for 
each cohort and was considered exempt from Institutional Review Board approval at the 
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas. The study followed the 
Transparent reporting of the multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or 
diagnosis (TRIPOD) and Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) 
reporting guidelines.26, 27
Candidate clinical covariates
Participants from all four cohorts underwent comprehensive evaluations at the study 
baseline, including self-reported history, assessment of clinical and anthropometric 
characteristics by examination, and laboratory tests using standardized protocols as detailed 
in the Supplemental Materials. In the present analysis, 54 demographic, anthropometric, 
clinic, electrocardiographic, and laboratory variables assessed at the study baseline were 
considered candidate covariates. Categorical candidate variables were harmonized across 
study cohorts. Troponin was measured as hs-cTnT in MESA and DHS and hs-cTnI in JHS 
and ARIC cohorts using commercially available assays as reported previously.28–31 NP 
levels were measured as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in JHS and N-terminal pro-B-type Segar et al. Page 4

(NT-proBNP) in ARIC, MESA, and DHS studies as reported previously.29, 30, 32, 33 NP 
and hs-cTn levels were each transformed into Z-scores as previously described to facilitate 
comparison across different assays.34 In total, 39 predictor variables were included in the 
present analysis after excluding 12 covariates for >20% missingness and 3 for correlation 
coefficient > 0.70 (Supplemental Table I).
Outcome of interest
The primary outcome of interest for the present study was incident HF. Each cohort 
follow-up was landmarked at one year from baseline visit to account for reverse causation 
secondary to potential subclinical HF at study baseline. Each cohort had at least 10 
years of follow-up for outcome assessment, and HF endpoints were censored at 10 years. 
Incident HF events were identified by the first hospitalization event with HF in each of 
the study cohorts and adjudicated according to standardized protocols as described in the 
Supplemental Materials.
Model development and evaluation
HF risk prediction models were developed separately for Black (JHS cohort) and White 
participants (ARIC cohort). The derivation cohort was randomly split into a training 
(50%) and testing dataset (50%). Imputation was performed on each dataset separately 
using random forest imputation to prevent data leakage across cohorts.35 The performance 
of the best performing ML-based algorithms were further compared to models derived 
using a similar approach 1) with only routine clinical covariates (age, sex, systolic blood 
pressure [BP], diastolic BP, heart rate, body mass index [BMI], smoking history, history 
of cardiovascular disease [CVD], history of diabetes), 2) clinical plus routine laboratory 
covariates (hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-
c]), 3) with only NP levels and only hs-cTn levels as covariates, 4) model that was not 
race-specific and was developed using the overall cohort (i.e, not derived separately for 
Black and White adults) with race as a co-variate, 5) model that was developed among 
individuals without any missing data on all the parameters. The analysis overview is shown 
in Figure 1.
ML-based methods:  In the training dataset, HF prediction models were developed 
incorporating the 39 covariates identified previously using the following six candidate ML-
based and traditional Cox algorithms: 1) oblique random survival forests (RSF); 2) forward 
stepwise Cox regression; 3) lasso Cox regression; 4) ridge Cox regression; 5) boosted Cox 
regression; 6) gradient boosted trees. A brief description of each method is provided in the 
Supplemental Materials.
Variable selection:  Variable selection was adjusted to optimize the number of covariates 
included in the HF risk prediction model. While oblique RSF can be used for risk prediction, 
random forest methods can also be used in variable selection.36 Permutation-based selection 
was performed to quantify variable importance (VIMP). Briefly, a predictor variable’s values 
were randomly permuted, and the importance of that variable was quantified by the resulting 
degradation in model prediction accuracy.20 A high VIMP suggests that permutation of the 
variable worsens predictive accuracy and, thus, the variable is important in model prediction. Segar et al. Page 5

Given the diminishing returns of model performance with additional covariates, the top 20 
variables in Black and White adults separately with the highest VIMP metrics were included 
in the ML-based algorithm with the highest discrimination.37
Statistical analysis
Internal validation in the development cohort was assessed using Monte Carlo cross-
validation. The discriminatory performance of each model was evaluated in the validation 
dataset (50% of the derivation cohort) by calculating the Harrell concordance index (C-
index).38 The data transformation, imputation, training, and testing steps were repeated 
1,000 times, with the final C-index reported as mean (95% confidence interval). The 
DeLong test was used to evaluate for differences between C-indices.39 Calibration of the 
HF risk prediction model with the best discrimination was assessed using the Greenwood-
Nam-D’Agostino statistic with a P-value > 0.05, indicating adequate calibration.40
External validation
The best performing HF risk prediction model in the internal validation dataset was 
evaluated in external datasets. The ML model for Black adults was externally validated 
in two separate cohorts of Black participants from 1) ARIC (excluding Black individuals 
enrolled in JHS) and 2) pooled MESA/DHS datasets. The ML model for White adults 
was externally validated in White participants from the pooled MESA/DHS cohort. The 
performance of ML-based models was further compared with the following well-established 
traditional Cox-regression based HF risk prediction models: the ARIC-HF biomarker, the 
Pooled Cohort Equations to Prevent Heart Failure (PCP-HF), and MESA-HF risk scores, 
each of which were developed in one the external validation cohorts.17–19 Finally, decision 
curves, a measure of the clinical net benefit, were compared between the ML, ARIC-HF, 
PCP-HF, and MESA-HF models.41 Decision curves measure the number of true positive 
cases identified without increasing the false positive rate at a specific risk threshold.
Sensitivity analysis
Several sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the 
ML-based race-specific HF risk prediction models. First, we compared the performance 
of the ML-based race-specific models in the other race (i.e., White race-specific model in 
Black participants and vice-versa) using discrimination, calibration metrics, and decision 
curve analysis. Second, to assess generalizability of the ML-based models in cohorts without 
biomarker data, we evaluated their performance in the validation cohorts with missing 
biomarker (NP and hs-cTn levels) data (i.e. setting the biomarker values to missing). Third, 
sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the performance of the ML-based model in 
a primary prevention population, excluding individuals with baseline atherosclerotic CVD. 
Fourth, subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the performance of the ML-based 
race-specific model in sex-based (men and women) subgroups. Finally, the performance of 
the ML-based race-specific model was assessed to predict the risk of incident HF subtypes 
[HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction]. For 
the HF subtype prediction analysis, the other HF subtype and mortality were considered as 
censoring events.Segar et al. Page 6

Contribution of specific risk factors to overall risk across races
To determine the proportion of HF incidence attributable to specific HF risk factor burden 
across races, we used Monte Carlo simulation of 1 million patients with risk factor burden 
similar to the ARIC cohort in both Black and White adults. A detailed description is 
provided in the Supplemental Materials. The predicted risk of each patient in the simulated 
cohorts was calculated using the best performing HF risk prediction model. The population 
attributable risk percentage (PARP) for each specific risk factor was estimated as the 
difference between the average risk in the unexposed group and the average risk in the 
overall population. For the PARP estimation, continuous variables were dichotomized into 
clinically meaningful categories using previously established cutoffs (BNP ≥ 30 pg/mL, 
NTproBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL, hs-cTn ≥ 14 ng/L). Analyses were performed using R version 
3.6.3 with a P-value < 0.05 indicating significance.
RESULTS
Study cohort and baseline characteristics
The derivation cohort for Black and White adults consisted of 4141 participants from JHS 
and 7858 participants from ARIC, respectively (Supplemental Figure I). MESA and the 
DHS contributed 1848 and 973 participants to the external validation cohort for Black 
adults (n=2821), respectively, while ARIC contributed 1024 participants. The external 
validation cohort for White adults (n=3236) consisted of 2595 participants from MESA 
and 641 participants from DHS. During a maximum follow-up of 10 years, there were 288 
[7.0%; male=99 (6.7%), female=189 (7.1%)] and 634 [8.1%; male=340 (9.4%), female=294 
(7.0%)] HF events among Black and White adults in the derivation cohorts, respectively. In 
the external validation cohort, 284 (7.4%, ARIC cohort=169 [16.5%] and MESA/DHS=115 
[4.1%]) Black and 100 (3.1%) White participants developed HF over a maximum of 10 
years of follow-up (Supplemental Figure II).
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of Black and White participants across the 
derivation and validation cohorts. Black adults had a greater burden of cardiovascular risk 
factors, including a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, higher body mass index, 
blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and greater chronic myocardial injury burden 
than White adults (Table 1). Conversely, White adults were more likely to be male and had 
higher rates of renal dysfunction and smoking than Black adults.
Derivation of prediction models
The 39 predictor covariates incorporated into the risk prediction models included 
demographics, anthropometrics, vital signs, social history, clinical history, medications, 
laboratory, and electrocardiographic parameters (Supplemental Table I). The C-indices for 
the ML-based race-specific HF risk prediction models are displayed in Table 2. Across 
both race groups, the oblique RSF (oRSF) model had the highest C-index of 0.88 (95% CI 
0.86–0.91) among Black adults and 0.89 (95% CI 0.86–0.91) among White adults. Across 
both races the forward stepwise Cox regression model had the lowest C-index [Black adults: 
0.76 (95% CI 0.71–0.80); White adults: 0.77 (95% CI 0.73–0.80)].Segar et al. Page 7
Circulation . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 March 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript

To improve clinical usability, we further constructed a model using the top 20 covariates 
identified by the VIMP metric in oRSF (Figure 2). Among Black adults, the C-index for the 
oRSF-top 20 model was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.90) and was not significantly different from 
the oRSF model that included all 39 variables (DeLong p-value = 0.38). Similarly, among 
White participants, discrimination of the oRSF model incorporating all covariates was not 
different from that which included only the top 20 variables with the highest VIMP metrics 
[0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.90)] (DeLong p-value = 0.22). Thus, the oRSF top-20 model was 
identified as the best performing model among Black and White adults (hereby referred to 
as the ML model). The oRSF models derived using only routine clinical variables or clinical 
and lab parameters had a lower overall C-index than the oRSF top-20 model (C-indices = 
0.75–0.76) (Table 3). Additionally, oRSF models with biomarkers only (NP alone or hs-cTn 
alone) also had a lower overall C-index than the oRSF top-20 (Table 3). Performance of the 
oRSF top-20 model was also superior to the non-race specific model derived in the overall 
cohort including race as a covariate (Table 2). Finally, in a cohort of participants with no 
missing data (n=10,053, 83.8% of the derivation cohort), the complete data oRSF top-20 
model performed similarly to the oRSF top-20 model with missing data (Table 3).
External validation of prediction models among Black adults
Among Black adults, the overall C-index for the ML risk score was high in both external 
validation cohorts [ARIC: 0.80 (95% CI 0.75–0.84); MESA/DHS: 0.83 (95% CI 0.77–
0.87)] (Table 4). Discrimination and calibration were acceptable in a cohort with missing 
biomarker data (Supplemental Table II). The ML risk score performance was also superior 
to other HF risk scores (ARIC-HF, MESA-HF, and PCP-HF) in external cohorts, including 
those which were used to derive these models (Table 4). Calibration was adequate for the 
ML model in both ARIC and MESA/DHS validation cohorts. In contrast, ARIC-HF and 
PCP-HF risk scores demonstrated good calibration among Black participants from the ARIC 
cohort, but not in the pooled cohort of MESA/DHS (Figure 2A-B). The MESA-HF risk 
score demonstrated adequate calibration in Black participants from both external validation 
cohorts (Figure 2A-B). In decision curve analysis, the ML model increased the number of 
heart failure events detected by 12, 17, and 19 per 1000-patients compared to the ARIC-HF, 
PCP-HF, and MESA-HF risk scores in the ARIC validation cohort (Supplemental Figure 
III). Similarly, in the pooled MESA/DHS validation cohort, the ML model detected an 
additional 6, 2, and 5 heart failure events per 1000-patients compared to the ARIC-HF, 
PCP-HF, and MESA-HF risk scores (Supplemental Figure III). In a primary prevention 
cohort of individuals without CVD, the ML model demonstrated improved discrimination 
and calibration compared with the other established risk scores (Supplemental Table III).
External validation of prediction models among White adults
In the external validation cohort of pooled White participants from DHS and MESA, the 
ML risk score had the greatest discrimination as assessed by the C-index of 0.82 (95% 
CI 0.78–0.86) followed by the MESA-HF, ARIC-HF, and PCP-HF risk scores, respectively 
(Table 4). Only the ML and MESA-HF risk scores had adequate calibration with similar 
predicted and observed risk of HF (p-value > 0.05) (Figure 2C). In decision curve analysis, 
the ML model detected an additional 3, 6, and 4 heart failure events per 1000-patients 
compared to the ARIC-HF, PCP-HF, and MESA-HF risk scores (Supplemental Figure III). Segar et al. Page 8
Circulation . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 March 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript

Discrimination and calibration were also acceptable in a cohort with missing biomarker data 
(Supplemental Table II). In a primary prevention cohort of individuals without CVD, the 
ML model demonstrated improved discrimination and calibration compared with the other 
established risk scores (Supplemental Table III).
Performance of Black- and White-specific models in the validation cohort of the other race
We evaluated the performance of the race-specific models in the other race (i.e., White 
model in Black participants and vice-versa) in the MESA/DHS external validation cohort. 
The discriminatory performance (C-index) of race-specific models was superior in race-
concordant vs. race-discordant cohorts (C-index of the Black model in Black vs. White 
participants = 0.83 vs. 0.80; C-index of the White model in White vs. Black participants 
= 0.82 vs. 0.78). Similarly, validation in race-discordant cohorts resulted in significant 
miscalibration (GND p-value < 0.05 for all) (Supplemental Table IV). In decision curve 
analysis, Black race-specific models detected an additional 6 cases per-1000 participants in 
the Black vs. White cohort. Similarly, the White race-specific model detected an additional 4 
cases per-1000 participants in the White vs. Black cohort (Supplemental Figure IV).
Performance of ML-based race-specific models in sex- and HF subtype-based groups
In sex-based subgroup analysis, the race-specific models demonstrated good and comparable 
performance in men and women across both races in the validation cohorts (Supplemental 
Table V). For the HF subtype outcomes, the Black race-specific model performed well in 
predicting risk of HFrEF [C-index = 0.84 (95% CI 0.79–0.90)] and HFpEF [C-index = 
0.82 (95% CI 0.76–0.87)] in the MESA/DHS validation cohort (Supplemental Table V). 
Similarly, the White race-specific model demonstrated good performance in predicting the 
risk of HFrEF [C-index = 0.83 (95% CI 0.77–0.89)] and HFpEF [C-index = 0.79 (95% CI 
0.74–0.85)] in the MESA/DHS cohort.
Differences in predictors of HF risk in Black vs. White adults
The variables identified as the top 20 most important parameters for HF risk prediction 
according to VIMP in Black and White adults are displayed in an alluvial plot (Figure 2). 
The key variables for predicting HF risk were mostly the same for both race groups except 
for body mass index, which was only included in the Black race model, and sex, which 
was only part of the White race model. NP level was the most important parameter in HF 
risk prediction for both race groups, followed by hs-cTn levels in Black individuals and 
ECG left ventricular mass measure (Cornell V oltage) in White individuals. Estimated GFR, 
cardiometabolic parameters (presence of diabetes, FPG), and socioeconomic characteristics 
(education and income levels) were more important predictors of HF risk in Black vs. White 
adults. The other important predictors of HF risk in White adults included prevalent CVD, 
traditional CVD risk factors (HTN, BP levels, HDL-c), and hs-cTn levels.
Among Black individuals, the highest PARP for incident HF was noted for elevated 
natriuretic peptide levels (NT-ProBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL, PARP: 21.1%) followed by cardiac 
troponin (hs-TnI ≥ 14 ng/L, PARP = 12.2%), annual income (upper-middle or above =

cardiac biomarkers was more modest (NT-ProBNP ≥ 125 = 17.9%, hs-cTn ≥ 14 ng/L = 
6.8%), lower than that associated with other risk factors such as FPG ≥ 140 mg/dL (4.3%) 
and annual income (7.4%) and higher among current smoking (9.1%) and LVH (8.0%) 
(Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
In this individual-level analysis of four prospective cohort studies, we developed and 
validated race-specific ML-based models to predict the 10-year risk of incident HF. We 
evaluated 6 unique ML-based algorithms and identified the oblique RSF model as the best 
performing HF risk prediction tool with excellent discrimination and calibration in external 
validation cohorts superior to previously developed risk scores. We similarly observed that 
ML models derived using race as a covariate have inferior performance than race-specific 
models. Using ML to identify the most important predictors of HF risk across racial groups, 
we noted differences in the risk factor profiles and relative importance and contribution 
of key predictors to the overall risk among Black and White adults. The present study 
supports the use of the ML model to identify Black and White individuals at higher risk 
for developing HF who may benefit from effective preventive strategies. To improve the 
clinically utility of our study, we implemented the ML model on a publicly available website 
(www.cvriskscores.com ) (Supplemental Figure V).
HF risk prediction and utilization of machine learning
A critical component of population-based strategies for preventing HF is identifying the 
highest risk individuals who may be targeted with effective preventive approaches. HF risk 
scores were previously developed in selected populations, including predominantly White 
adults in the Framingham Heart Study, older individuals in the Health ABC study, and more 
recently among adults with no prior history of CVD in the PCP-HF study.14, 15, 19 Recent 
studies included more diverse populations and incorporated traditional risk factors into Cox 
models to estimate HF risk.16, 18 Model performance has improved with the inclusion 
of biomarkers, specifically NT-proBNP in the ARIC-HF and MESA-HF models.16–18 
However, traditional statistical modeling with Cox proportional hazard regression is unable 
to include non-linear outcomes or missing or correlated variables.
ML utilizes less stringent techniques that allow for the inclusion of large amounts of 
multidimensional data and has been shown to predict adverse events in population-based 
cohort studies.42 Furthermore, ML models are better equipped to handle missing data on 
covariates and non-linear interactions between covariates compared with traditional Cox 
models. In the current study, of 54 candidate covariates, 39 variables were incorporated 
in risk prediction models. While all 6 ML-based algorithms had excellent discrimination 
for HF risk prediction, the oRSF model had the best performance. The oRSF model 
incorporating the top 20 most important predictors of HF risk, which included clinical 
parameters and cardiac biomarkers, outperformed previously established risk prediction 
tools. The oRSF top-20 model outperformed traditional models, including those developed 
in the external validation cohorts, and included biomarkers as covariates (ARIC and MESA 
HF risk score).Segar et al. Page 10

Need for race-specific HF risk scores
Despite differences in HF epidemiology across races, most traditional HF risk prediction 
tools are not race-specific and incorporate self-reported race as a covariate adjustment in 
the risk prediction equation.16 Self-reported Black race is a heterogeneous entity and a 
surrogate marker for several factors including but not limited to genetics, socioeconomic 
status, cultural elements, and often unmeasured societal experiences related to structured 
racism.43, 44 The disproportionately higher risk of HF and other adverse outcomes in 
Black individuals is related to the downstream effects of all these components, which may 
not be adequately accounted for by adjusting for race in the risk models. Accordingly, 
there is a growing consensus to move away from race as a risk predictor approach.45 In 
the present study, we developed and validated HF risk prediction models in Black and 
White participants separately as a strategy to better elucidate the importance of risk factors 
that may be most relevant to development of HF in Black individuals. The ML-based 
race-specific HF risk models developed in this study included individuals with as well as 
without baseline CVD and complement the existing race- and sex-specific Cox-model based 
PCP-HF risk score which is focused on the primary prevention population.19 The ML-based 
race-specific models demonstrated superior performance in the race concordant validation 
cohorts as compared with the other race. Furthermore, the race-specific ML model for HF 
risk demonstrated superior performance than non-race specific ML models which included 
race as a covariate. Overall, these findings highlight the prognostic utility of race-specific 
risk assessment for HF.
HF risk factors and relative differences among Black and White adults
In addition to providing a race-specific HF risk stratification tool, our study also provides 
key insights into the differences in the risk factors for HF development among Black versus 
White adults. Across both races, we observed that NP levels were the most important 
predictor of HF risk. Biomarkers of chronic myocardial injury were a more important risk 
predictor in Black vs. White individuals. Furthermore, the PARP associated with cardiac 
biomarkers for HF risk was higher in Black vs. White individuals. This is particularly 
noteworthy because among Black individuals, chronic myocardial injury is more prevalent 
and has been associated with a disproportionately higher risk of HF.28 Socioeconomic 
factors such as income and cardiometabolic parameters (FPG, presence of diabetes) were 
also of higher importance and associated with higher PARP for incident HF among Black vs. 
White individuals.
Besides differences in relative importance of predictor variables shared across both race-
specific models, there were unique variables identified as key predictors of HF risk in 
Black vs. White adults. Sex was identified as a significant predictor variable only in White 
individuals and BMI was a significant for incident HF only in Black individuals. These 
differences may be related to differences in the epidemiology of HF development in Black 
vs. White adults. For example, as noted in our study and by others,6 sex differences in risk 
of HF in Black adults are more modest as compared with those noted among White adults, 
likely due to high baseline risk of HF among Black women.9 This may explain why sex is 
one of the top predictors of HF risk only in the White race model.6 It is also plausible that 
the contribution of certain factors to HF risk may be accounted for by other covariates and Segar et al. Page 11
Circulation . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 March 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript

the interactions between covariates. For example, the contribution of female sex to HF risk 
in Black individuals may be accounted for by BMI and other cardiometabolic parameters, 
which are already in the model.46, 47
Role of biomarkers in risk prediction using ML-based models
Our ML-based models also highlight the role of biomarker assessment, in addition to 
routinely captured clinical risk factors, for improved risk stratification. Across both race 
groups, NP levels were identified as the single most important predictor of HF risk. 
Additionally, hs-cTn was a significant predictor of HF risk but more so in Black versus 
White adults. We observed improved discrimination with the oRSF top-20 model as 
compared with the ML models with clinical parameters only as well as those with 
biomarkers only. This is particularly important as high-sensitivity assays for troponin are 
currently available and can be routinely assessed in outpatient setting. Additionally, the 
2017 ACC/AHA HF Focused Update recommends NP screening as part of a HF prevention 
strategy.48 Complementing our study findings, previous studies have also demonstrated 
the utility of cardiac biomarkers in identifying individuals with risk factors such as 
hypertension, diabetes, pre-diabetes who may be at a higher risk of developing HF and may 
benefit from targeted preventive strategies.49, 50 However, cardiac biomarkers may not be 
routinely available among all at-risk participants, particularly those without existing CVD. 
The ML models demonstrated robust performance in subgroups with missing biomarker data 
and among individuals without CVD at baseline, highlighting their generalizability across 
different clinical settings. A pragmatic application of the ML-based models for HF risk 
prediction in the real-world may involve a multi-step approach tailored to the population in 
consideration. For example, in the general primary prevention population without biomarker 
data, clinical risk factors can be used to predict risk as the first step followed by selective 
biomarker testing to refine risk prediction by capturing residual risk of HF.
Clinical implications and future directions
The ML model for HF risk prediction developed in the present study can identify high-
risk individuals who are most likely to benefit from effective preventive therapies. These 
strategies may include lifestyle interventions to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and weight 
loss,51, 52 intensive blood pressure control,53 and initiation of pharmacotherapies such as 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors among individuals with type 2 diabetes.54
A key next step for the practical implementation of the ML-based race-specific model in 
the clinical setting is its integration with electronic health records (EHR). This will not 
only improve accessibility and real-world application of these ML-based models but also 
allow for better and automated capture of data on the risk prediction variables. To this 
end, continued improvements in EHR software will allow ML models to be developed 
and stored on a secure cloud server and implemented in the EHR through the use of 
an application programming interface (API) (Supplemental Figure VI). The next steps to 
facilitate integration of the ML-based race-specific models with the EHR include storing the 
models on a secure cloud-computing server, developing an API to access our race-specific 
models, and scaling the platform to provide real-time estimates of a patient’s HF risk.Segar et al. Page 12

Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, we only included risk factors that were consistently 
available across all cohorts at the baseline visit in the derivation cohorts. Data on important 
predictors of HF risk such as echocardiographic characteristics were not included in the 
derivation of the risk prediction model. However, the ML model included a wide range of 
clinical variables including traditional risk factors as well as biomarkers with established 
prognostic importance that have not been included in other HF risk prediction tools.19 
While echocardiographic parameters are able to accurately risk stratify HF prognosis, 
echocardiograms are not routinely obtained in patients without suspected HF. It is thus 
possible the ML models can improve resource allocation of echocardiograms for individuals 
at highest risk for HF. Second, we could not account for several social risk factors including 
structural racism, access to care, and racial disparities in management of CV risk factors 
which may influence the risk of HF among Black participants or for individuals who identify 
as neither White nor Black. Future cohort studies that better capture the effects of long-
standing societal racism and disparities may improve our HF risk model performance by 
incorporating objective measures of these microaggressions and allopathic load. Similarly, 
data on relevant lifestyle factors such as physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and 
adiposity measures, which may differ across races and are associated with risk of HF, was 
not available.51, 55, 56 However, the ML-based models demonstrate robust performance even 
in absence of data on key parameters and across different subgroups and sensitivity analysis. 
Furthermore, through the use of an API, the ML-based models can be continuously updated 
as these data become available in additional cohorts. Finally, HF event adjudication differed 
slightly across all cohorts, and HF subtypes were not systematically captured. However, each 
cohort study has its own well-established, pre-specified criteria for HF event ascertainment, 
and the model performance was tested separately in each specific cohort and demonstrated 
good discrimination and calibration.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we used ML to develop race-specific models to predict the 10-year risk 
of incident HF and externally validated these findings in large population-based cohorts. 
The ML models displayed excellent discrimination and calibration among Black and White 
adults. Finally, using ML to identify the most important predictors of HF risk across racial 
groups, we found a similar profile of risk factors with substantial differences in the relative 
importance and contribution to the overall risk of specific parameters among Black and 
White adults.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
What is new?
• Race-specific, ML-based HF risk models that integrate clinical, laboratory, 
and biomarker data demonstrate superior performance compared with 
traditional HF risk and non-race specific ML models.
• Among the risk factors, natriuretic peptide levels were the most important 
predictor of HF risk across both races, followed by troponin levels, glycemic 
parameters, and socioeconomic factors in Black adults.
• The EKG-based measure of Cornell voltage and left ventricular hypertrophy, 
prevalent cardiovascular disease, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors 
were stronger predictors of HF risk in White adults.
What are the clinical implications?
• The race-specific machine learning models for heart failure risk prediction 
can identify high-risk individuals who are most likely to benefit from effective 
approaches to heart failure prevention.
• Implementation and integration of race-specific ML-based models for HF risk 
prediction with electronic health record systems can improve the accessibility 
and real-world application of these tools.Segar et al. Page 19
