Social Determinants of Health and Disparities in 
Hypertension and Cardiovascular Diseases

ABSTRACT: High blood pressure causes over 10 million preventable deaths annually globally. Populations in low- and 
middle-income countries suffer the most, experiencing increased uncontrolled blood pressure and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) deaths. Despite improvements in high-income countries, disparities persist, notably in the United States, where 
Black individuals face up to 4× higher CVD mortality than White individuals. Social determinants of health encompass 
complex, multidimensional factors linked to an individual’s birthplace, upbringing, activities, residence, workplaces, 
socioeconomic and environmental structures, and significantly affect health outcomes, including hypertension and CVD. 
This review explored how social determinants of health drive disparities in hypertension and related CVD morbidity from 
a socioecological and life course perspective. We present evidence-based strategies, emphasizing interventions tailored 
to specific community needs and cross-sector collaboration to address health inequalities rooted in social factors, which 
are key elements toward achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 for reducing premature CVD 
mortality by 30% by 2030. (Hypertension. 2024; 81:387–399. DOI: 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21354.)

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading preventable 
risk factor for global mortality, causing over 10 mil-
lion deaths annually.1 Low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) suffer the most, with <20% of individ-
uals achieving adequate BP control, and hypertension- 
related cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths have 
been rising over the past 3 decades. In high-income 
countries (HICs), BP control is ≈50% with decreasing 
hypertension-related CVD deaths, but disparities persist, 
particularly among low-income, rural, and racial/ethnic 
minorities. In the United States, Black individuals experi-
ence about 4× the hypertension-related CVD mortality 
than White individuals.2,3Social determinants of health (SDOH) are a multi-
dimensional measure encompassing factors related to 
where people are born, raised, engage in activities, reside, 
and work, which exert a significant influence on health 
outcomes, including hypertension and CVD. These fac-
tors include a wide array of elements that span socioeco-
nomic and environmental structures and have a significant 
impact on both community- and individual-level health. 
They encompass issues such as housing and living con-
ditions, neighborhood poverty, food security, access to 
green spaces, transportation, racial or other forms of dis-
advantaged minority segregation, structured racism, and 
various psychosocial stressors. Collectively, these factors

Chaturvedi et al SDOH in Hypertension and CVDshape individuals’ health behaviors, fostering unhealthy 
practices that directly impact stress levels, leading to 
heightened sympathetic activity, markers of inflammation, 
and enhanced susceptibility to hypertension and CVD 
with potential epigenetic transmission to offspring.4
Limited access to affordable, high-quality health care 
compounds these challenges, hindering timely diagnosis 
and treatment, and leading to accelerated progression of 
vascular disease with high morbidity and mortality. Exter-
nal factors like climate change, environmental pollution, 
natural disasters, wars, and conflicts further exacerbate the prevalence of hypertension and CVD. These profound 
impacts of SDOH on hypertension and CVD are illustrated 
in Figure 1. Catastrophic health expenses from CVD dis-
proportionately affects low-income communities, perpetu-
ating suffering, and deepening socioeconomic disparities.5
This review summarizes how SDOHs contribute to 
hypertension and related CVD disparities from a global 
perspective focusing on comparisons between LMICs 
and HIC, as well as rural-urban and racial/ethnic dis-
parities within HICs. Additionally, we discuss adaptable 
evidence-based strategies and comprehensive solutions 
that integrate social and clinical interventions to tackle 
SDOHs and disparities in hypertension and related CVD. 
These equity-focused approaches offer a promising path 
toward achieving United Nation’s Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals 3.4 for reducing premature CVD mortality by 
2030 and the Healthy People 2030’s goal for equitable 
health.6,7
DISPARITIES IN BURDEN OF

prevalence has doubled to 626 million in women and 
652 million in men, with disproportionately steeper

cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Social determinants of health (SDOHs) encompass socioeconomic, political, and environmental contexts, including neighborhood poverty and 
poor housing conditions, social policies and built environment, public health policies and legislation, climate change and pollution, and crisis 
events. These SDOHs contribute to an increased risk of premature CVD and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) through health care system 
and psychosocial stress pathway, such as sympathetic-adreno-medullar and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. BP indicates blood

Chaturvedi et al SDOH in Hypertension and CVDrise in LMICs (Figure 2).8,9 In 2019, high systolic BP 
was linked to 10.9 million deaths and 235.4 million 
disability-adjusted life years worldwide.10 Hypertension-
related disability-adjusted life years decreased in HICs 
but increased in LMICs between 1990 and 2019, with 
HICs reporting significantly lower age-adjusted mortal-
ity rates due to high systolic BP (72 per 100 000) than 
LMICs (187 per 100 000).11
Despite favorable trends in HICs, substantial dis-
parities persist, with higher CVD mortality rates in rural 
areas and racial/ethnic minorities. In the United States, 
although age-adjusted CVD mortality rates declined for 
Black and White individuals from 2000 to 2019 with 
a simultaneous decrease in Black-White disparities, 
Black individuals consistently demonstrated the high-
est mortality rates than other ethnicities, especially in 
rural areas (Figure 3; Figure S1).12 Moreover, existing 
racial disparities were exacerbated during the COVID-
19 pandemic, as indicated by the widening Black-White 
disparities in stroke mortality (Figure S2).13 Non-
Hispanic Black individuals have higher hypertension 
rates, early CVD onset, and increased CVD mortality 
compared with Whites.2,14 Although the gap in racial 
disparities in BP control seemed to be narrowing in 
some regional studies in the United States, more recent 
data from a national cohort showed that BP differ-
ences and respective control rates have not changed 
much in the past 20 years.15,16 Canadian studies also reveal significantly higher hypertension rates among 
Black and South Asian individuals, particularly women, 
compared with Whites.17 In the United Kingdom, Black 
patients with chronic condition have significantly poorer 
BP control than White patients.18 Even in Taiwan, where 
BP control rates are among the world’s highest, indig-
enous women face substantially worse BP levels.19
SOCIOECOLOGICAL AND LIFE COURSE 
PERSPECTIVES OF SDOH RELATED TO 
HYPERTENSION AND CVD
SDOH is a multidimensional concept encompassing 
social, environmental, economic, and psychosocial fac-
tors that interact over an individual’s lifetime. These fac-
tors are closely linked to the life course theory, which 
examines how early and later life biological, behavioral, 
social, and psychological exposures affect an individu-
al’s health.20 The Whitehall longitudinal cohort studies 
led by Sir Michael Marmot, for example, have signifi-
cantly advanced our understanding of health dispari-
ties by emphasizing the impact of both early and later 
life circumstances on health outcomes, including CVD 
mortality.21
In line with the life course theory, substantial evidence 
has accumulated that early life stress, especially during 
the periconceptual and prenatal periods, is linked with 
Figure 2. Trends in the number of people with hypertension who reported a diagnosis, who used treatment, and whose blood 
pressure was effectively controlled, globally and by region, 1990 to 2019.

Chaturvedi et al SDOH in Hypertension and CVDthe subsequent development of hypertension and CVD, 
primarily through epigenetic alterations.4 For instance, 
studies on famine episodes demonstrated associations 
between maternal undernutrition and an increased risk 
of hypertension and coronary heart disease in offspring.22 
Additionally, preterm and low birth weight infants have 
higher systolic BP later in life.23 Maternal malnutrition 
and low birth weight are still highly prevalent, especially 
in low-income countries, where 40% of childbearing-age 
women are anemic, and 25% of newborns have low birth 
weights.24
Hypertension in childhood, along with other car-
diovascular risk factors (body mass index and cho-
lesterol level), can lead to intermediate CVD markers 
and potentially fatal CVD events in adulthood (Figure 
S3).25,26
Early childhood growth patterns independently 
impact hypertension and CVD development.4 For exam-
ple, in the Helsinki Birth Cohort, adults with coronary 
events often had low birth weights followed by rapid 
childhood weight gain, linked to insulin resistance later 
in life.27
Through a life course and socioecological perspective, 
we explore the impact of key SDOHs on hypertension 
and CVD. We also provide an overview of widely refer-
enced SDOH frameworks (Table S1).
Neighborhood Poverty, Poor Housing 
Environment, and Living Conditions
While BP was once positively associated with national 
income and urbanization, this relationship had weakened 
by 2015, suggesting hypertension is disproportionally 
affecting the poor population globally.9 Of note, over 2 
billion of the world’s poor population live in rural areas 
or informal urban settlements in LMICs, facing a con-
stant threat of eviction and harsh living conditions.28 
An analysis of 138 LMICs showed that countries with 
higher gross domestic product, more health investment, and improved multidimensional poverty index have lower 
hypertension prevalence, highlighting the importance of 
favorable policies and equitable health care spending for 
better BP control.29
In HICs, residing in underprivileged neighborhoods 
was associated with an elevated risk of developing coro-
nary heart disease, even after adjusting for individuals’ 
income, educational attainment, and occupation.30 In the 
United States, individuals living in rural areas exhibit a 
higher incidence of hypertension (40%) compared with 
their urban counterparts (29%).31 Studies conducted in 
impoverished neighborhoods in LMICs and rural areas 
in HICs reveal that individuals in these settings often 
prioritize basic necessities like stable housing, food, and 
electricity over health.32
Food Insecurity and Unhealthy Lifestyle 
Behaviors
Social disadvantaged individuals often face limited 
opportunities for healthy lifestyle choices, leading to 
adoption of unhealthy behaviors due to structural social 
and environmental factors.
Food Insecurity
Food insecurity, defined as “limited or uncertain access 
to sufficient food,” is associated with obesity, a known 
risk factor for hypertension, particularly in women in 
HICs.33 This is mainly driven by the consumption of 
energy-dense ultra-processed foods (UPFs) during 
scarcity.34 Moreover, a low-sodium diet rich in fruits, 
vegetables, grains, and low-fat dairy products is rec-
ommended for lowering BP.35 However, in impover-
ished neighborhoods, food insecurity is compounded 
by unfavorable trade policies, making fresh produce 
unaffordable. For example, in LMICs, the cost of rec-
ommended fruit and vegetable servings can account 
for up to half of household income, while in HICs, it is 
< 2%.36

Chaturvedi et al SDOH in Hypertension and CVDIn 2015, over 42 million people in the United States 
lived in food-insecure households, including 13 million 
children.37 Moreover, roughly 40% individuals with CVD 
experienced food insecurity, which is twice as high as 
those without CVD with a disproportionate impact on 
Black and Hispanic adults.38
Cheap and Widely Accessible UPF
A concerning trend is the rising popularity of UPFs, 
due to their affordability, palatability, convenience, and 
long shelf life. However, they are nutritionally poor and 
high in unhealthy fat, sugar, and salt levels.39 This trend 
is prominent globally with higher sales in developed 
regions and increasing consumption in developing 
countries.40
Recent evidence has connected high UPF consump-
tion to a 12% greater risk of CVD, including a 13% higher 
risk of coronary heart disease and an 11% higher risk 
of stroke.41 Low-income neighborhoods, both in HICs 
and LMICs, often have easier access to cheaper UPFs, 
overshadowing healthier but pricier options.42 Food and 
beverage companies further exacerbate this by targeting 
marketing at low-income neighborhoods, racial/ethnic 
minorities, adolescents, and children.43
Low Physical Activity, Tobacco, and Alcohol Use
Physical activity is an established protective factor 
against hypertension and CVD events.35 However, peo-
ple with low socioeconomic position (SEP), character-
ized by lower income, education, and employment, are 
less physically active due to factors like time constraints, 
lack of motivation, neighborhood safety, and limited rec-
reational facilities.44,45 While tobacco may not be a direct 
hypertension risk factor, it significantly increases the 
risk for all CVD subtypes, especially in individuals with 
hypertension.46 Additionally, data consistently show no 
safe alcohol limits for incident CVD, especially stroke.47 
Studies in the United States observed higher rates of 
alcohol and tobacco use in non-Hispanic Blacks com-
pared with Whites, and in rural compared with urban 
residents.48
Low SEP
Marmot’s Social Gradient in Health concept illustrates 
the positive correlation between health status and 
SE P.49,50 In HICs, low SEP is directly associated with 
higher hypertension risk.51 However, this link was not 
evident in most LMICs until the 1990s when CVD, previ-
ously predominant among affluent individuals, begins to 
increasingly affect those with low SEP due to epidemio-
logical transition from infectious to chronic disease.52,53
Individuals with lower SEP experience elevated risk 
of CVD and mortality primarily because of the higher 
prevalence of unhealthy behaviors, increased psycho-
social stress, and limited health care access within this 
population.54Data from both LMICs and HICs consistently high-
light the strong association between lower education 
levels and hypertension/CVD. The INTERHEART study 
found that individuals with lower education levels had 
a higher risk for myocardial infarction compared with 
those with higher education levels.55 Similarly, the Pro-
spective Urban Rural Epidemiology study showed that 
low education level was a significant risk factor for inci-
dent CVD and associated mortality, especially in LMICs 
(Figure 4).56 Moreover, educational opportunities are 
closely linked with employment rates and economic 
stability, which, in turn, significantly influence cardiovas-
cular outcomes.57 In the United States, the REGARDS 
study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences 
in Stroke) revealed that socially determined vulnerabili-
ties, such as low education and income levels, living in 
high-poverty areas, and lacking health insurance, were 
associated with a higher risk of developing hypertension 
and mortality.58
Psychosocial Experiences
Adverse psychosocial experiences during the life 
course such as structural racism, poor social cohesion, 
and work-related stress are associated with adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes through various plausible 
pathways,59 including sympathetic nervous system and 
inflammation leading to impaired vascular reactivity 
and endothelial function,60 and indirect influences from 
unhealthy coping habits such as poor diet and physical 
inactivity.61
Adverse Childhood Experiences
Adverse childhood experiences, including mistreatment, 
abuse, or dysfunctional home environments, are asso-
ciated with increased risk of hypertension and CVD in 
adulthood. Adverse childhood experiences amplify sus-
ceptibility to unhealthy behaviors, epigenetic alterations, 
and systemic inflammation, thereby increasing vulner-
ability to CVD.48,61 Notably, a significant percentage of 
the world poorest households lack adequate child super-
vision, with ≈40% of children out of school, and 48% of 
these households lack anyone with at least 5 years of 
education.28
Structural Racism
In HICs, racial/ethnic disparities in hypertension and 
CVD burden are evident, which are primarily attributed 
to inequities and undertreatment experienced by racial/
ethnic minority groups (Blacks, Hispanics, and Southeast 
Asians), resulting in poorer BP control and subsequently 
increasing CVD risk.62,63 In the United States, 33% of 
the Black-White disparity in uncontrolled BP could be 
explained by SDOHs, including low-income, low edu-
cation, disadvantaged neighborhoods, and residing in 
health professional shortage areas.64

Social isolation adversely affects health behaviors, car-
diovascular risk factors, and mortality.65,66 Conversely, 
increased social contact was associated with a 13% 
lower prevalence of treatment-resistant hypertension 
among Black people.67 Furthermore, job strain (charac-
terized by high psychological demands and low decision 
latitude on the job) and night shift work have been asso-
ciated with elevated BP and CVD risk.68
Mechanistic Insights Into Psychosocial Stress, 
Hypertension, and CVD
A growing body of evidence links psychosocial stress 
to cardiovascular health, including hypertension.69,70 
Data suggest that psychosocial stress from perceived 
adverse neighborhood conditions is associated with 
hypertension, likely due to abnormal epigenetic alter-
nations including DNA methylation, histone modifica-
tion, and RNA regulation.4,71,72 Stress activates both the 
sympathetic-adrenal-medullary and the hypothalamic-  
pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to increased catechol-
amines, glucocorticoids, and inflammatory cytokines.73,74 
Perceived stress, gauged by amygdala activity, predicts 
future CVD via increased hematopoietic activity and arterial inflammation, suggesting the existence of a neural-  
hematopoietic-arterial axis.75,76 A study showed 
that stress-related neural activity is associated with 
increased vascular inflammation in individuals from 
racial/ethnic minority communities and resource-  
limited neighborhoods, providing further insights into 
how adverse social conditions can increase hyperten-
sion and CVD risk.60
Health Systems
A major barrier to implementing proven strategies for 
chronic disease prevention is the design and functioning 
of health care systems involving health financing, gover-
nance, workforce, information, medical technologies, and 
health care delivery.77 In many LMICs, screening services 
for chronic conditions are frequently lacking, particularly 
in impoverished and rural areas. Inadequate infrastructure, 
including poorly maintained roads, long travel distances, and 
transportation costs, hinder routine and emergency care.
Studies in LMICs indicate that less than half of indi-
viduals with hypertension are diagnosed, and less than 
a third effectively controlled their BP. A recent pooled 
analysis of 1201 studies showed grossly suboptimal BP 
control rates (under 25%) in Nepal, Indonesia, and some

concerning, certain North African, Central and South 
Asian, and Eastern European countries exhibit control 
rates below 10%.8 Ill-equipped primary care facilities 
lacking readily available medications add another barrier 
to optimal hypertension management in these regions.78
Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of hypertension 
in LMICs lead to a higher CVD burden. Patients with 
acute CVD events often arrive too late for life-saving 
reperfusion therapy. The situation is worse in rural areas 
due to limited resources and transportation barriers, 
causing increased mortality.
In the United States, 1 in 10 individuals lacks afford-
able health insurance, and these uninsured individuals 
are more likely to have poorer BP control.79,80 Similar 
to LMICs, rural areas in HICs face additional barriers in 
hypertension care due to physician and equipment short-
ages, and lack of transportation.31
Climate Change and Pollution
Climate change has a detrimental impact on hypertension 
and CVD. Activities like burning fossil fuels and defor-
estation release greenhouse gases, leading to extreme 
temperatures and water-related disasters, contribute to 
hypertension- and CVD-related morbidity and mortality, 
partly by disrupting access to medications and health care 
services for chronic diseases.81–83 Ambient air pollution is 
a known risk factor for hypertension and CVD.84 These 
adverse effects of climate change and pollution are com-
pounded in socially deprived populations in LMICs.
Crisis Events: Pandemic and Displaced 
Populations
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted 
social, economic, and psychological aspects of lives, 
impacting individuals and communities alike. It has ampli-
fied preexisting disparities in cardiovascular care, under-
lining accessibility challenges.13,85,86 Studies showed 
significantly higher hypertension rates among hospital-
ized COVID-19 patients, reaching up to 50% to 56%, 
which were correlated with disease severity, intensive 
care unit admission likelihood, and mortality risk.87 Data 
indicate disproportionately higher mortality in Black, 
Latino, and South Asian populations in the United States 
during the pandemic.88
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AND CALL 
TO ACTION TO ADDRESS SDOH AND 
ELIMINATE DISPARITIES IN BP CONTROL 
AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH
Hypertension is the leading preventable risk fac-
tor for CVD mortality on a global scale. The increasing disparities in BP control between LMICs and HICs are 
fundamentally driven by SDOHs. Among HICs, like the 
United States, a significant 15-year life expectancy gap 
persists between privileged and underprivileged individu-
als, emphasizing the need to view hypertension manage-
ment strategies through a social equity lens.89 Therefore, 
addressing the SDOHs related to hypertension and CVD 
via community and clinical interventions needs to be a 
national and global priority.
Achieving this goal necessitates a multifaceted 
approach, integrating SDOH measures into evidence-
based health systems initiatives and policy reforms. 
These reforms should emphasize BP control while simul-
taneously targeting reductions in tobacco and alcohol 
use, promoting healthy lifestyles, reducing obesity, and 
facilitating referrals to address context-specific SDOHs, 
such as food subsidies and transportation. Moreover, 
combating structural racism, climate change, and envi-
ronmental pollution will be instrumental in achieving 
these goals.
While eliminating all social and environmental fac-
tors may not be entirely feasible, implementing stress 
management techniques, particularly for the socially 
disadvantaged, can help mitigate their negative impact 
on cardiovascular health.4,90 Furthermore, community 
engagement and empowerment are essential for the 
long-term sustainability of these efforts.91,92 The Sustain-
able Development Goals 3.4 has set a clear target to 
reduce premature CVD mortality by 30% by 2030, rela-
tive to 2015 levels.6 Improving BP control in the socially 
vulnerable populations globally will be key to achieving 
those targets, and it cannot be possible without address-
ing SDOHs. The key priorities to achieve these objec-
tives are outlined (Table):
1. Enhance national coordination of hypertension and 
CVD prevention and mitigate SDOH impact on 
socially vulnerable populations
National health ministries must prioritize enhanc-
ing hypertension care, especially in marginalized com-
munities in low-income neighborhoods, rural areas, and 
among racial/ethnic minorities. Establishing a dedicated 
task force is essential to ensure that initiatives related to 
hypertension care across the health care system work 
together effectively. In addition to health care services, 
this task force should foster collaboration with various 
sectors, including education, housing, food, transpor-
tation, and others, to address SDOHs that influence 
hypertension and CVD within socially disadvantaged 
populations.
2. Integrate social determinants in hypertension care
Nonconventional, team-based care models with 
trained nonphysician health workers, like community 
health workers, show promise in improving hyperten-
sion awareness, prevention, and control, particularly in 
resource-limited settings, as reflected in the recent World 
Health Organization guidelines.93 Studies conducted in

Chaturvedi et al SDOH in Hypertension and CVDnationally.95,96 Trials in Colombia, Malaysia, China, and 
Nepal with similar intervention components showed con-
sistent results.97–99 In the United States, the Black Bar-
bershop trial found that the engagement of nonphysician 
health workers with barbers in Los Angeles County was 
cost-effective and successful in reducing BP.100
Studies suggest that incorporating SDOHs into 
treatment plans of patients with hypertension and con-
current depression may significantly improve their BP 
control.101,102 The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices in the United States has developed a screening 
tool for unmet health-related social needs, including 
housing instability, food insecurity, transportation difficul-
ties, utility assistance needs, and interpersonal safety.103 
To maximize the impact, these measurements should be 
integrated into hypertension care at every step, such as 
providing subsidies for healthy food to socially disadvan-
taged populations.
3. Ensure access to essential medications for hyper-
tension and CVD among the socially disadvan-
taged populations and expand social insurance 
schemes.
Inadequate access to antihypertensive and CVD medi-
cations poses a significant barrier to effective BP control. 
Addressing this challenge entails fostering public-private 
partnerships to ensure consistent supply of essential 
medications and reducing co-payment costs to improve 
outcomes.104,105
Additionally, health care financing schemes must 
encompass transportation options for socially disadvan-
taged individuals. These efforts also align closely with 
the Sustainable Development Goals, which advocate for 
equitable and affordable access to high-quality care for 
all.6
4. Leverage maternal and child health and infectious 
disease care delivery platforms.
Opportunistic screening, awareness, and treatment of 
hypertension should be encouraged by leveraging the 
existing outreach infrastructure established for mater-
nal and child health services and infectious diseases 
(eg, COVID-19, tuberculosis, HIV) in LMICs.106 Such 
approaches ensure equitable care delivery while keeping 
the marginal cost of scaling up the intervention low.
5. Start hypertension and CVD preventive efforts 
early in children and adolescents.
Initiating prevention efforts early in childhood and ado-
lescence through school-based interventions promoting 
physical activity and healthy eating, while encouraging 
parental involvement can significantly reduce body mass 
index and BP.107 Unfortunately, in the world’s poorest 
communities, as many as 40% of children do not attend 
school.28 To address this issue, primary health care facili-
ties can partner with educational foundations to enroll 
children in school.
6. Provide pro-poor healthy food and environmental 
policies and subsidies.Societies should prioritize healthier lifestyles by 
reducing salt, sugar, tobacco, and alcohol consumption, 
while promoting increased intake of fruit and vegetable, 
and physical activity. National policies and interventions 
should ensure affordable seasonal produce and offer 
subsidies for marginalized groups to promote health 
equity.2,36
7 . Address racism as a social issue.
Efforts to ensure health equity in hypertension care 
require proactive antiracism measures, encompassing 
advocacy, policy development, and practical implementa-
tion strategies. These measures must include adapting 
interventions to the specific needs of the socially disad-
vantaged, equipping health care providers with the cul-
tural competencies necessary for unbiased and shared 
decision-making, promoting diversity within the health 
care workforce, and enforcing anti-discriminatory poli-
cies.108 Findings from ongoing REGARDS study suggest 
that racial disparities in cardiovascular health can partly 
be attenuated by interventions targeting neighborhood 
physical environment, neighborhood safety, social cohe-
sion, and discrimination.109
8. Leverage digital technology and enhance digital 
literacy.
Digital health initiatives, such as mobile-based health 
(mHealth) applications, have shown effectiveness in 
improving BP control by improving medication adherence 
in both HICs and LMICs.110,111 Additionally, wearable BP 
monitoring devices can be integrated into a virtual-first 
hypertension care model; however, their accuracy valida-
tion remains a challenge.112 Concerns also exist regard-
ing the accessibility of digital services in remote areas 
and a lack of digital literacy. Addressing these challenges 
requires collaborative efforts involving both the health 
and nonhealth sectors.
9. International agencies and donor support for 
hypertension care.
World Health Organization Global Action Plan targets 
a 25% reduction in hypertension prevalence by 2025 
relative to 2010.113 This goal is achievable through effec-
tive collaboration between governmental and nongov-
ernmental entities.11,90 Key global and regional initiatives 
aiming to eliminate dipartites in BP control and cardio-
vascular health are listed in the Table.
10. Research and capacity strengthening.
Efforts are needed to scale up the evidence-based 
interventions for hypertension care for socially disadvan-
taged populations. National data on hypertension, along 
with other CVD risk factors and related SDOHs, should 
be systematically collected and reported on a regular 
basis. Equally important is the generation and interpreta-
tion of local data, health system performance monitor-
ing, and the establishment of mechanisms for continuous 
quality improvement in hypertension care. This requires 
investing in professionals with expertise spanning quan-
titative, qualitative, and social sciences, along with skills

Chaturvedi et al SDOH in Hypertension and CVDin implementation research. Similarly, human resource 
development and capacity-building initiatives, focused 
on-the-job training programs, can improve hypertension 
care by bridging the knowledge gap among primary care 
physicians and strengthening the referral system in a 
sustained manner.114,115
CONCLUSIONS
Despite numerous clinical practice guidelines for hyper-
tension management, uncontrolled BP remains the 
leading cause of preventable deaths, especially among 
socially disadvantaged groups. In this review, we have 
provided a comprehensive overview of the SDOHs signif-
icantly influencing the burden of hypertension and CVD. 
Our examination took a socioecological and life course 
perspective, emphasizing the interconnected behavioral, 
biological, and psychological pathways at play. It is cru-
cial to underscore that addressing the SDOHs related 
to hypertension and CVD demands concerted efforts on 
both national and global levels complemented by robust 
community engagement, social financing, and strategic 
partnerships with nonhealth sector entities, including 
municipal organizations, faith-based institutions, schools, 
small businesses, and psychosocial support systems. 
Creating an enabling environment conducive to healthy 
behaviors, such as promoting a nutritious diet and provid-
ing accessible green spaces for physical activity, along 
with tobacco control measures, is essential. Additionally, 
ensuring access through efficient transportation and 
digital technology is vital. When implemented collectively, 
these measures hold great promise for achieving equita-
ble BP control, preventing CVD, and ultimately eliminating 
related disparities in line with the Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals 3.4 and Healthy People 2030 mission.
