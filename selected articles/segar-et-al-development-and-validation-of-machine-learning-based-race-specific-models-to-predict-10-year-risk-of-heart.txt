BACKGROUND:  Heart failure (HF) risk and the underlying risk factors vary by race. Traditional models for HF risk prediction 
treat race as a covariate in risk prediction and do not account for significant parameters such as cardiac biomarkers. Machine 
learning (ML) may offer advantages over traditional modeling techniques to develop race-specific HF risk prediction models 
and to elucidate important contributors of HF development across races.
METHODS:  We performed a retrospective analysis of 4 large, community cohort studies (ARIC [Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities], DHS [Dallas Heart Study], JHS [Jackson Heart Study], and MESA [Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis]) 
with adjudicated HF events. The study included participants who were >40 years of age and free of HF at baseline. Race-
specific ML models for HF risk prediction were developed in the JHS cohort (for Black race–specific model) and White 
adults from ARIC (for White race–specific model). The models included 39 candidate variables across demographic, 
anthropometric, medical history, laboratory, and electrocardiographic domains. The ML models were externally validated 
and compared with prior established traditional and non–race-specific ML models in race-specific subgroups of the pooled 
MESA/DHS cohort and Black participants of ARIC. The Harrell C-index and Greenwood-Nam-D’Agostino χ2 tests were 
used to assess discrimination and calibration, respectively.
RESULTS:  The ML models had excellent discrimination in the derivation cohorts for Black (n=4141 in JHS, C-index=0.88) 
and White (n=7858 in ARIC, C-index=0.89) participants. In the external validation cohorts, the race-specific ML model 
demonstrated adequate calibration and superior discrimination (Black individuals, C-index=0.80–0.83; White individuals, 
C-index=0.82) compared with established HF risk models or with non–race-specific ML models derived with race included 
as a covariate. Among the risk factors, natriuretic peptide levels were the most important predictor of HF risk across both 
races, followed by troponin levels in Black and ECG-based Cornell voltage in White individuals. Other key predictors of HF 
risk among Black individuals were glycemic parameters and socioeconomic factors. In contrast, prevalent cardiovascular 
disease and traditional cardiovascular risk factors were stronger predictors of HF risk in White adults.
CONCLUSIONS:  Race-specific and ML-based HF risk models that integrate clinical, laboratory, and biomarker data demonstrated 
superior performance compared with traditional HF risk and non–race-specific ML models. This approach identifies distinct 
race-specific contributors of HF.

Segar et al ML-Based Race-Specific Models for HF RiskHeart failure (HF) affects >64 million adults world-
wide and accounts for nearly 6% of the total 
health care expenditure in North America and 
Europe.1,2 As a result of the growing burden of cardio-
vascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes and more prolonged survival after myocardial infarction and 
incident HF, the prevalence is expected to increase.3 The 
lifetime risk of developing HF is 20% to 46% and varies 
substantially by race.4,5 Race is a social construct and 
Black adults are more likely to develop HF compared 
with White individuals in large part because of structural 
racism, social inequality, poor health care access, and a 
greater downstream burden of cardiovascular risk fac-
tors such as hypertension and diabetes.6–8 In addition, 
Black adults have a higher prevalence of subclinical phe-
notypes such as left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic 
myocardial injury assessed by high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin (hs-cTn), which are associated with higher risk 
of HF.9 In contrast, natriuretic peptide (NP) levels are 
lower among Black adults, further suggesting potential 
differences in the determinants of HF risk across racial 
groups.10,11 After the development of HF, prognosis is 
poor and Black adults appear to have significantly higher 
risk of adverse events, particularly HF hospitalization, 
compared with other racial groups.12 Thus, there is a 
global need for effective approaches to the prevention of 
HF, but the optimal strategies may differ by race.13
Risk stratification tools to identify individuals at higher 
risk for developing HF are available and can help tar-
get those at high risk with appropriate preventive strat-
egies.14–19 However, most existing HF risk prediction 
models do not include key prognostic markers such as 
hs-cTn and NP levels.14,15,19 Furthermore, most existing 
HF risk prediction models, with the exception of the 
recently developed Pooled Cohort Equation to Prevent 
Heart Failure (PCP-HF) risk score,19 are not race spe-
cific, have been developed in biracial or mixed ethnic 
cohorts, and incorporate race only as a covariate. Self-
reported race as a covariate in such risk models may not 
completely capture the social and biological pathways 
that might predispose Black individuals to a higher risk 
of HF. In addition, current HF risk prediction tools were 
developed with classic statistical modeling techniques 
constrained by assumptions such as distribution normal-
ity, noninformative or random censoring, and hazard risk 
linearity.20 Machine learning (ML) methods use large, 
multidimensional data efficiently and may improve HF 
risk prediction.
In the present study, we developed HF risk predic-
tion models separately in Black participants and White 
participants as a strategy to better elucidate the impor-
tance of risk factors that may be most relevant to the 
development of HF across races. Specifically, using ML 
techniques incorporating clinical parameters, including 
biomarker data, we developed and externally validated 
race-specific risk models to predict the 10-year risk of 
incident HF in Black adults and White adults. We com-
pared the performance of ML-based race-specific mod-
els to the established HF risk prediction models and 
non–race-specific ML model derived with race used as a 
covariate. We further identified the distinct associations Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Race-specific, machine learning–based heart fail-
ure (HF) risk models that integrate clinical, labo-
ratory, and biomarker data demonstrate superior 
performance compared with traditional HF risk and 
non–race-specific machine learning models.
• Among the risk factors, natriuretic peptide lev-
els were the most important predictors of HF risk 
across both races, followed by troponin levels, gly-
cemic parameters, and socioeconomic factors in 
Black adults.
• The ECG-based measure of Cornell voltage and left 
ventricular hypertrophy, prevalent cardiovascular dis-
ease, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors were 
stronger predictors of HF risk in White adults.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The race-specific machine learning models for HF 
risk prediction can identify high-risk individuals who 
are most likely to benefit from effective approaches 
to HF prevention.
• Implementation and integration of race-specific 
machine learning–based models for HF risk pre-
diction with electronic health record systems can 
improve the accessibility and real-world application 
of these tools.

Segar et al ML-Based Race-Specific Models for HF Riskof several risk factors and clinical characteristics with HF 
development in Black adults and White adults.
METHODS
Requests to access the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities Study), DHS (Dallas Heart Study), JHS (Jackson 
Heart Study), and MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) 
data sets can be obtained by the respective study coordinating 
institutions. Details on the software code used in this study are 
provided in the Data Supplement and available from the cor-
responding author on reasonable request.
Study Population
The present study included individual-level data from 4 cohort 
studies: ARIC, DHS, JHS, and MESA. The study design, enroll-
ment criteria, participant characteristics, and event adjudica-
tion for each cohort have been described previously and are 
discussed briefly in the Data Supplement.21–25 For the present 
analysis, the initial (visit 1) phases of JHS (2000–2004), DHS 
(2000–2002), and MESA (2000–2004) and visit 4 for the 
ARIC cohort (1996–1998) are considered the baseline vis-
its to allow similar follow-up time and consistent availability of 
biomarkers across cohorts. Adults <40 years of age or those 
with a history of HF at study baseline were excluded from each 
cohort (Figure I in the Data Supplement).
Race-specific HF risk prediction models were developed 
in a derivation cohort and subsequently externally validated 
(Figure 1). Data from JHS were used to derive the HF risk 
prediction model for Black participants. The HF risk prediction 
model for Black adults was validated in 2 separate cohorts of 
(1) a subset of Black participants from ARIC, excluding par-
ticipants who were also enrolled from Jackson, MS, and were 
included in JHS; and (2) a pooled cohort of Black participants 
from MESA and DHS. The HF risk prediction model for White 
participants was developed using data from ARIC and exter-
nally validated among White participants from the pooled 
MESA/DHS data set. Written informed consent was obtained 
from all study participants, and local institutional review boards 
approved the study protocols. The present analysis was 
approved by the coordinating centers for each cohort and was 
considered exempt from institutional review board approval at 
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas. 
The study followed the TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of 
the Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis 
or Diagnosis) and PROBAST (Prediction Model Risk of Bias 
Assessment Tool) reporting guidelines.26,27
Candidate Clinical Covariates
Participants from all 4 cohorts underwent comprehensive eval-
uations at the study baseline, including self-reported history, 
assessment of clinical and anthropometric characteristics by 
examination, and laboratory tests using standardized protocols 
as detailed in the Data Supplement. In the present analysis, 54 
demographic, anthropometric, clinic, electrocardiographic, and 
laboratory variables assessed at the study baseline were con-
sidered candidate covariates. Categorical candidate variables 
were harmonized across study cohorts. Troponin was mea-
sured as hs-cTnT in MESA and DHS and as hs-cTnI in JHS and ARIC cohorts with commercially available assays as reported 
previously.28–31 NP levels were measured as BNP (B-type 
NP) in JHS and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type NP) in 
ARIC, MESA, and DHS studies as reported previously.29,30,32,33 
NP and hs-cTn levels were each transformed into z  scores as 
previously described to facilitate comparison across different 
assays.34 In total, 39 predictor variables were included in the 
present analysis after the exclusion of 12 covariates for >20% 
missingness and 3 for correlation coefficient >0.70 (Table I in 
the Data Supplement).
Outcome of Interest
The primary outcome of interest for the present study was 
incident HF. Each cohort follow-up was landmarked at 1 year 
from baseline visit to account for reverse causation secondary 
to potential subclinical HF at study baseline. Each cohort had 
at least 10 years of follow-up for outcome assessment and HF 
end points were censored at 10 years. Incident HF events were 
identified by the first hospitalization event with HF in each of 
the study cohorts and adjudicated according to standardized 
protocols as described in the Data Supplement.
Model Development and Evaluation
HF risk prediction models were developed separately for Black 
(JHS cohort) and White participants (ARIC cohort). The deri-
vation cohorts were randomly split into a training (50%) and 
testing (50%) data set. Imputation was performed on each data 
set separately using random forest imputation to prevent data 
leakage across cohorts.35 The performance of the best-per-
forming ML-based algorithms was further compared with that 
of models derived with a similar approach: (1) with only routine 
clinical covariates (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, diastolic 
blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, smoking history, 
history of cardiovascular disease [CVD], history of diabetes); 
(2) clinical plus routine laboratory covariates (hemoglobin A1c, 
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol); (3) with 
only NP levels and only hs-cTn levels as covariates; (4) model 
that was not race-specific and was developed using the overall 
cohort (ie, not derived separately for Black adults and White 
adults) with race as a covariate; and (5) model that was devel-
oped among individuals without any missing data on all the 
parameters. The analysis overview is shown in Figure 1.
ML-Based Methods
In the training data set, HF prediction models were developed 
incorporating the 39 covariates identified previously using 
the following 6 candidate ML-based and traditional Cox algo-
rithms: (1) oblique random survival forest (oRSF), (2) forward 
stepwise Cox regression, (3) lasso Cox regression, (4) ridge 
Cox regression, (5) boosted Cox regression, and (6) gradient 
boosted trees. A brief description of each method is provided 
in the Data Supplement.
Variable Selection
Variable selection was performed to optimize the number of 
covariates included in the HF risk prediction model. While 
oRSF can be used for risk prediction, random forest methods 
can also be used in variable selection.36 Permutation-based 
selection was performed to quantify variable importance 
(VIMP). Briefly, the values of a predictor variable were randomly

Segar et al ML-Based Race-Specific Models for HF Riskpermuted and the importance of that variable was quantified 
by the resulting degradation in model prediction accuracy.20 
A high VIMP suggests that permutation of the variable wors-
ens predictive accuracy and thus the variable is important 
in model prediction. Given the diminishing returns of model 
performance with additional covariates, the top 20 variables 
in Black adults and White adults separately with the highest 
VIMP metrics were included in the ML-based algorithm with 
the highest discrimination.37
Statistical Analysis
Internal validation in the development cohort was assessed 
with Monte Carlo cross-validation. The discriminatory perfor-
mance of each model was evaluated in the validation data 
set (50% of the derivation cohort) by calculating the Harrell 
concordance index (C-index).38 The data transformation, 
imputation, training, and testing steps were repeated 1000 
times, with the final C-index reported as mean (95% CI). The 
DeLong test was used to evaluate for differences between 
C-indices.39 Calibration of the HF risk prediction model with the best discrimination was assessed with the Greenwood-
Nam-D’Agostino (GND) statistic, with a value of P >0.05 indi-
cating adequate calibration.40
External Validation
The best-performing HF risk prediction model in the internal 
validation data set was evaluated in external data sets. The ML 
model for Black adults was externally validated in 2 separate 
cohorts of Black participants from (1) ARIC (excluding Black 
individuals enrolled in JHS) and (2) pooled MESA/DHS data 
sets. The ML model for White adults was externally validated 
in White participants from the pooled MESA/DHS cohort. 
The performance of ML-based models was further compared 
with the following well-established traditional Cox regression–
based HF risk prediction models: the ARIC-HF biomarker, 
the PCP-HF, and MESA-HF risk scores, each of which were 
developed in one of the external validation cohorts.17–19 Last, 
decision curves, a measure of the clinical net benefit, were 
compared between the ML, ARIC-HF, PCP-HF, and MESA-HF 
models.41 Decision curves measure the number of true-positive Figure 1. Analysis overview for identifying best-performing risk prediction model.

specific risk threshold.
Sensitivity Analysis
Several sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to 
assess the robustness of the ML-based race-specific HF risk 
prediction models. First, we compared the performance of the 
ML-based race-specific models in the other race (ie, White 
race–specific model in Black participants and vice versa) using 
discrimination, calibration metrics, and decision curve analysis. 
Second, to assess generalizability of the ML-based models 
in cohorts without biomarker data, we evaluated their perfor-
mance in the validation cohorts with missing biomarker (NP and 
hs-cTn levels) data (ie, setting the biomarker values to miss-
ing). Third, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the 
performance of the ML-based model in a primary prevention 
population, excluding individuals with baseline atherosclerotic 
CVD. Fourth, subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate 
the performance of the ML-based race-specific model in sex-
based (men and women) subgroups. Last, the performance of 
the ML-based race-specific model was assessed to predict the 
risk of incident HF subtypes (HF with reduced ejection fraction 
and HF with preserved ejection fraction). For the HF subtype 
prediction analysis, the other HF subtype and mortality were 
considered as censoring events.
Contribution of Specific Risk Factors to Overall 
Risk Across Races
To determine the proportion of HF incidence attributable to 
specific HF risk factor burden across races, we used a Monte 
Carlo simulation of 1 million patients with risk factor burden 
similar to the that of the ARIC cohort in both Black adults and 
White adults. A detailed description is provided in the Data 
Supplement. The predicted risk of each patient in the simu-
lated cohorts was calculated with the best-performing HF risk 
prediction model. The population attributable risk percentage 
(PARP) for each specific risk factor was estimated as the dif-
ference between the average risk in the unexposed group 
and the average risk in the overall population. For the PARP 
estimation, continuous variables were dichotomized into clini-
cally meaningful categories using previously established cut-
offs (BNP ≥ 30 pg/mL, NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL, hs-cTn ≥ 14 
ng/L). Analyses were performed with R version 3.6.3, with a 
value of P <0.05 indicating statistical significance.
RESUL TS
Study Cohort and Baseline Characteristics
The derivation cohort for Black adults and White adults 
consisted of 4141 participants from JHS and 7858 par-
ticipants from ARIC, respectively (Figure I in the Data 
Supplement). MESA and the DHS contributed 1848 
and 973 participants to the external validation cohort for 
Black adults (n=2821), respectively, and ARIC contrib-
uted 1024 participants. The external validation cohort 
for White adults (n=3236) consisted of 2595 partici-
pants from MESA and 641 participants from DHS. Dur-ing a maximum follow-up of 10 years, there were 288 
(7 .0%; male, 99 [6.7%], female, 189 [7 .1%]) and 634 
(8.1%; male, 340 [9.4%], female, 294 [7 .0%]) HF events 
among Black adults and White adults in the derivation 
cohorts, respectively. In the external validation cohort, 
284 (7 .4%; ARIC cohort, 169 [16.5%] and MESA/DHS, 
115 [4.1%]) Black and 100 (3.1%) White participants 
developed HF over a maximum of 10 years of follow-up 
(Figure II in the Data Supplement).
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of Black 
participants and White participants across the derivation 
and validation cohorts. Black adults had a greater burden 
of cardiovascular risk factors, including a higher preva-
lence of hypertension and diabetes; higher body mass 
index, blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG); 
and greater chronic myocardial injury burden than White 
adults (Table 1). Conversely, White adults were more 
likely to be male and had higher rates of renal dysfunc-
tion and smoking than Black adults.
Derivation of Prediction Models
The 39 predictor covariates incorporated into the risk 
prediction models included demographics, anthropo-
metrics, vital signs, social history, clinical history, medi-
cations, laboratory, and electrocardiographic parameters 
(Table I in the Data Supplement). The C-indices for 
the ML-based race-specific HF risk prediction models 
are displayed in Table 2. Across both race groups, the 
oRSF model had the highest C-index of 0.88 (95% 
CI, 0.86–0.91) among Black adults and 0.89 (95% CI, 
0.86–0.91) among White adults. Across both races, the 
forward stepwise Cox regression model had the lowest 
C-index (Black adults, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.71–0.80]; White 
adults, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.73–0.80]).
To improve clinical usability, we further constructed 
a model using the top 20 covariates identified by the 
VIMP metric in oRSF (Figure 2). Among Black adults, 
the C-index for the oRSF top 20 model was 0.88 (95% 
CI, 0.85–0.90) and was not significantly different from 
the oRSF model that included all 39 variables (DeLong 
P=0.38). Similarly, among White participants, discrimi-
nation of the oRSF model incorporating all covariates 
was not different from that of the model that included 
only the top 20 variables with the highest VIMP metrics 
(0.88 [95% CI, 0.85–0.90]; DeLong P=0.22). Thus, the 
oRSF top 20 model was identified as the best-perform-
ing model among Black adults and White adults (hereby 
referred to as the ML model).
The oRSF models derived using only routine clinical 
variables or clinical and laboratory parameters had a lower 
overall C index than the oRSF top 20 model (C-indices, 
0.75–0.76; Table 3). In addition, oRSF models with bio-
markers only (NP alone or hs-cTn alone) also had a lower 
overall C index than the oRSF top 20 (Table 3). Perfor-
mance of the oRSF top-20 model was also superior to

External Validation of Prediction Models Among 
Black Adults
Among Black adults, the overall C-index for the ML risk 
score was high in both external validation cohorts (ARIC, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.75–0.84]; MESA/DHS, 0.83 [95% 
CI, 0.77–0.87]; Table 4). Discrimination and calibration 
were acceptable in a cohort with missing biomarker data 
(Table II in the Data Supplement). The ML risk score 
performance was also superior to other HF risk scores 
(ARIC-HF, MESA-HF, and PCP-HF) in external cohorts, 
including those that were used to derive these models 
(Table 4). Calibration was adequate for the ML model in 
both the ARIC and MESA/DHS validation cohorts. In 
contrast, the ARIC-HF and PCP-HF risk scores demon-
strated good calibration among Black participants from 
the ARIC cohort but not in the pooled cohort of MESA/Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of Black Adults and White Adults, by Derivation and Validation Cohorts

Segar et al ML-Based Race-Specific Models for HF RiskExternal Validation of Prediction Models Among 
White Adults
In the external validation cohort of pooled White par-
ticipants from DHS and MESA, the ML risk score had 
the greatest discrimination as assessed by the C index 
of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.78–0.86), followed by the MESA-
HF, ARIC-HF, and PCP-HF risk scores (Table 4). Only 
the ML and MESA-HF risk scores had adequate cali-
bration with similar predicted and observed risk of HF 
(P>0.05; Figure 3C). In decision curve analysis, the ML 
model detected an additional 3, 6, and 4 HF events 
per 1000 patients compared with the ARIC-HF, PCP-
HF, and MESA-HF risk scores (Figure III in the Data 
Supplement). Discrimination and calibration were also 
acceptable in a cohort with missing biomarker data 
(Table II in the Data Supplement). In a primary preven-
tion cohort of individuals without CVD, the ML model 
demonstrated improved discrimination and calibration 
compared with the other established risk scores (Table 
III in the Data Supplement).
Performance of Black Race–Specific and White 
Race–Specific Models in the Validation Cohort 
of the Other Race
We evaluated the performance of the race-specific 
models in the other race (ie, White model in Black par-
ticipants and vice versa) in the MESA/DHS external 
validation cohort. The discriminatory performance (C-
index) of race-specific models was superior in race-
concordant versus race-discordant cohorts (C-index 
of the Black model in Black versus White participants, 
0.83 versus 0.80; C-index of the White model in White 
versus Black participants, 0.82 versus 0.78). Similarly, 
validation in race-discordant cohorts resulted in sig-
nificant miscalibration (Greenwood-Nam-D’Agostino 
P<0.05 for all; Table IV in the Data Supplement). In 
decision curve analysis, Black race–specific models 
detected an additional 6 cases per 1000 participants 
in the Black versus White cohort. Similarly, the White 
race–specific model detected an additional 4 cases 
per 1000 participants in the White versus Black cohort 
(Figure IV in the Data Supplement).Performance of ML-Based Race-Specific 
Models in Sex- and HF Subtype–Based Groups
In sex-based subgroup analysis, the race-specific models 
demonstrated good and comparable performance in men 
and women across both races in the validation cohorts 
(Table V in the Data Supplement). For the HF subtype 
outcomes, the Black race–specific model performed well 
in predicting risk of HF with reduced ejection fraction (C 
index, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.79–0.90]) and HF with preserved 
ejection fraction (C index, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.76–0.87]) in the 
MESA/DHS validation cohort (Table V in the Data Supple-
ment). Similarly, the White race–specific model demon-
strated good performance in predicting the risk of HF with 
reduced ejection fraction (C-index, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.77–
0.89]) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (C-index, 
0.79 [95% CI, 0.74–0.85]) in the MESA/DHS cohort.
Differences in Predictors of HF Risk in Black 
Versus White Adults
The variables identified as the top 20 most important 
parameters for HF risk prediction according to VIMP in 
Black adults and White adults are displayed in an alluvial 
plot in Figure 2. The key variables for predicting HF risk 
were mostly the same for both race groups except for 
body mass index, which was included only in the Black 
race model, and sex, which was part of only the White 
race model. NP level was the most important parameter 
in HF risk prediction for both race groups, followed by hs-
cTn levels in Black individuals and electrocardiographic 
left ventricular mass measure (Cornell voltage) in White 
individuals. Estimated glomerular filtration rate, cardio-
metabolic parameters (presence of diabetes, FPG), and 
socioeconomic characteristics (education and income 
levels) were more important predictors of HF risk in Black 
versus White adults. The other important predictors of HF 
risk in White adults included prevalent CVD, traditional 
CVD risk factors (hypertension, blood pressure levels, 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and hs-cTn levels.
Among Black individuals, the highest PARP for inci-
dent HF was noted for elevated NP levels (NT-proBNP 
≥125 pg/mL; PARP, 21.1%), followed by cardiac troponin 
(hs-TnI ≥14 ng/L; PARP, 12.2%), annual income (upper Table 3. Discrimination of the Reference Machine Learning Clinical Variables, Natriuretic Peptide Only, Troponin Only, and

DISCUSSION
In this individual-level analysis of 4 prospective cohort 
studies, we developed and validated race-specific ML-
based models to predict the 10-year risk of incident HF. 
We evaluated 6 unique ML-based algorithms and iden-
tified the oRSF model as the best-performing HF risk 
prediction tool with excellent discrimination and calibra-
tion in external validation cohorts and improved perfor-mance compared to previously developed risk scores. 
We similarly observed that ML models derived with race 
used as a covariate have inferior performance compared 
with race-specific models. Using ML to identify the most 
important predictors of HF risk across racial groups, we 
noted differences in the risk factor profiles and rela-
tive importance and contribution of key predictors to 
the overall risk among Black adults and White adults. 
The present study supports the use of the ML model to 
identify Black individuals and White individuals at higher 
risk for developing HF who may benefit from effective 
preventive strategies. To improve the clinical utility of our 
study, we implemented the ML model on a publicly avail-
able website42 (Figure V in the Data Supplement).

Segar et al ML-Based Race-Specific Models for HF Riskwho may be targeted with effective preventive approach-
es. HF risk scores were previously developed in selected 
populations, including predominantly White adults in the 
Framingham Heart Study, older individuals in the Health 
ABC study (Health, Aging, and Body Composition), and 
more recently among adults with no history of CVD in 
the PCP-HF study.14,15,19 Recent studies included more 
diverse populations and incorporated traditional risk fac-
tors into Cox models to estimate HF risk.16,18 Model per-
formance has improved with the inclusion of biomarkers, 
specifically NT-proBNP in the ARIC-HF and MESA-HF 
models.16–18 However, traditional statistical modeling with 
Cox proportional hazard regression is unable to include 
nonlinear outcomes or missing or correlated variables.
ML uses less stringent techniques that allow for the 
inclusion of large amounts of multidimensional data and 
has been shown to predict adverse events in population-
based cohort studies.43 Furthermore, ML models are bet-
ter equipped to handle missing data on covariates and 
nonlinear interactions between covariates compared 
with traditional Cox models. In the current study, of 54 
candidate covariates, 39 variables were incorporated into 
risk prediction models. Although all 6 ML-based algo-
rithms had excellent discrimination for HF risk prediction, 
the oRSF model had the best performance. The oRSF 
model incorporating the top 20 most important predic-
tors of HF risk, which included clinical parameters and 
cardiac biomarkers, outperformed previously established 
risk prediction tools. The oRSF top 20 model outper-
formed traditional models, including those developed in the external validation cohorts, and included biomarkers 
as covariates (ARIC and MESA HF risk score).
Need for Race-Specific HF Risk Scores
Despite differences in HF epidemiology across races, 
most traditional HF risk prediction tools are not race 
specific and incorporate self-reported race as a covariate 
adjustment in the risk prediction equation.16 Self-report-
ed Black race is a heterogeneous entity and a surrogate 
marker for several factors, including but not limited to 
genetics, socioeconomic status, cultural elements, and 
often unmeasured societal experiences related to struc-
tured racism.44,45 The disproportionately higher risk of HF 
and other adverse outcomes in Black individuals is re-
lated to the downstream effects of all these components, 
which may not be adequately accounted for by adjusting 
for race in the risk models. Accordingly, there is a grow-
ing consensus to move away from race as a risk predic-
tor approach.46 In the present study, we developed and 
validated HF risk prediction models in Black participants 
and White participants separately as a strategy to better 
elucidate the importance of risk factors that may be most 
relevant to development of HF in Black individuals. The 
ML-based race-specific HF risk models developed in this 
study included individuals with and without baseline CVD 
and complement the existing race- and sex-specific Cox-
model based PCP-HF risk score, which is focused on 
the primary prevention population.19 The ML-based race-
specific models demonstrated superior performance in AB

ic ML model for HF risk demonstrated superior perfor-
mance than non–race-specific ML models that included 
race as a covariate. Overall, these findings highlight the 
prognostic utility of race-specific risk assessment for HF.
HF Risk Factors and Relative Differences 
Among Black Adults and White Adults
In addition to providing a race-specific HF risk stratification 
tool, our study provides key insights into the differences in 
the risk factors for HF development among Black versus 
White adults. Across both races, we observed that NP lev-
els were the most important predictor of HF risk. Biomark-
ers of chronic myocardial injury were a more important risk 
predictor in Black versus White individuals. Furthermore, 
the PARP associated with cardiac biomarkers for HF 
risk was higher in Black than in White individuals. This is 
particularly noteworthy because among Black individuals 
chronic myocardial injury is more prevalent and has been 
associated with a disproportionately higher risk of HF.28 
Socioeconomic factors such as income and cardiometa-
bolic parameters (FPG, presence of diabetes) were also 
of higher importance and associated with higher PARP for 
incident HF among Black versus White individuals.
Besides differences in relative importance of predictor 
variables shared across both race-specific models, there 
were unique variables identified as key predictors of HF 
risk in Black versus White adults. Sex was identified as a 
significant predictor variable only in White individuals, and 
body mass index was a significant for incident HF only in 
Black individuals. These differences may be related to dif-
ferences in the epidemiology of HF development in Black 
versus White adults. For example, as noted in our study and 
by others,6 sex differences in risk of HF in Black adults are 
more modest compared with those noted among White 
adults, likely because of high baseline risk of HF among 
Black women.9 This may explain why sex is one of the top 
predictors of HF risk only in the White race model.6 It is 
also plausible that the contribution of certain factors to 
HF risk may be accounted for by other covariates and the 
interactions between covariates. For example, the contri-
bution of female sex to HF risk in Black individuals may be 
accounted for by body mass index and other cardiometa-
bolic parameters, which are already in the model.47, 4 8
Role of Biomarkers in Risk Prediction Using 
ML-Based Models
Our ML-based models also highlight the role of biomarker 
assessment, in addition to routinely captured clinical risk 
factors, for improved risk stratification. Across both race 
groups, NP levels were identified as the single most im-
portant predictor of HF risk. In addition, hs-cTn was a sig-
nificant predictor of HF risk, but more so in Black versus White adults. We observed improved discrimination with 
the oRSF top 20 model compared with the ML models 
with clinical parameters only and those with biomarkers 
only. This is particularly important because high-sensitivity 
assays for troponin are currently available and can be rou-
tinely assessed in outpatient setting. In addition, the 2017 
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Associa-
tion HF focused update recommends NP screening as part 
of an HF prevention strategy.49 Complementing our study 
findings, previous studies have also demonstrated the util-
ity of cardiac biomarkers in identifying individuals with risk 
factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and prediabetes 
who may be at a higher risk of developing HF and may 
benefit from targeted preventive strategies.50,51 However, 
cardiac biomarkers may not be routinely available among 
all at-risk participants, particularly those without existing 
CVD. The ML models demonstrated robust performance 
in subgroups with missing biomarker data and among in-
dividuals without CVD at baseline, highlighting their gen-
eralizability across different clinical settings. A pragmatic 
application of the ML-based models for HF risk prediction 
in the real world may involve a multistep approach tailored 
to the population under consideration. For example, in the 
general primary prevention population without biomarker 
data, clinical risk factors can be used to predict risk as the 
first step, followed by selective biomarker testing to refine 
risk prediction by capturing residual risk of HF.
Clinical Implications and Future Directions
The ML model for HF risk prediction developed in the 
present study can identify high-risk individuals who are 
most likely to benefit from effective preventive thera-
pies. These strategies may include lifestyle interventions 
to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and weight loss,52,53 
intensive blood pressure control,54 and initiation of phar-
macotherapies such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
inhibitors among individuals with type 2 diabetes.55
A key next step for the practical implementation of the 
ML-based race-specific model in the clinical setting is its 
integration with electronic health records. This will not 
only improve accessibility and real-world application of 
these ML-based models but also allow better and auto-
mated capture of data on the risk prediction variables. 
To this end, continued improvements in electronic health 
record software will allow ML models to be developed 
and stored on a secure cloud server and implemented 
in the electronic health record through the use of an 
application programming interface (Figure VI in the Data 
Supplement). The next steps to facilitate integration of 
the ML-based race-specific models with the electronic 
health record include storing the models on a secure 
cloud-computing server, developing an application pro-
gramming interface to access our race-specific models, 
and scaling the platform to provide real-time estimates of 
a patient’s HF risk.

Segar et al ML-Based Race-Specific Models for HF RiskLimitations
Our study has several limitations. First, we included only 
risk factors that were consistently available across all 
cohorts at the baseline visit in the derivation cohorts. 
Data on important predictors of HF risk such as echo-
cardiographic characteristics were not included in the 
derivation of the risk prediction model. However, the 
ML model included a wide range of clinical variables 
such as traditional risk factors and biomarkers with 
established prognostic importance that have not been 
included in other HF risk prediction tools.19 Although 
echocardiographic parameters are able to accurately 
risk-stratify HF prognosis, echocardiograms are not 
routinely obtained in patients without suspected HF. It is 
thus possible that the ML models can improve resource 
allocation of echocardiograms for individuals at highest 
risk for HF. Second, we could not account for several 
social risk factors, including structural racism, access 
to care, and racial disparities in management of car-
diovascular risk factors, which may influence the risk of 
HF among Black participants or individuals who iden-
tify as neither White nor Black. Future cohort studies 
that better capture the effects of long-standing societal 
racism and disparities may improve our HF risk model 
performance by incorporating objective measures of 
these microaggressions and allopathic load. Similarly, 
data on relevant lifestyle factors such as physical ac-
tivity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and adiposity measures, 
which may differ across races and are associated with 
risk of HF, were not available.52,56,57 However, the ML-
based models demonstrate robust performance even 
in the absence of data on key parameters and across 
different subgroups and sensitivity analysis. Further-
more, through the use of an application programming 
interface, the ML-based models can be continuously 
updated as these data become available in additional 
cohorts. Last, HF event adjudication differed slightly 
across all cohorts, and HF subtypes were not system-
atically captured. However, each cohort study has its 
own well-established, prespecified criteria for HF event 
ascertainment, and the model performance was tested 
separately in each specific cohort and demonstrated 
good discrimination and calibration.
Conclusions
We used ML to develop race-specific models to predict 
the 10-year risk of incident HF and externally validated 
these findings in large population-based cohorts. The ML 
models displayed excellent discrimination and calibration 
among Black adults and White adults. Last, using ML to 
identify the most important predictors of HF risk across 
racial groups, we found a similar profile of risk factors 
with substantial differences in the relative importance 
and contribution to the overall risk of specific parameters 
among Black adults and White adults.ARTICLE INFORMATION
