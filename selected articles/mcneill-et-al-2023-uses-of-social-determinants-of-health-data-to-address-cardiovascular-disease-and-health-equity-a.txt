BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Prior research suggests that 
social determinants of health have a compounding effect on health and are associated with cardiovascular disease. This 
scoping review explores what and how social determinants of health data are being used to address cardiovascular disease 
and improve health equity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: After removing duplicate citations, the initial search yielded 4110 articles for screening, and 50 studies 
were identified for data extraction. Most studies relied on similar data sources for social determinants of health, including geo -
coded electronic health record data, national survey responses, and census data, and largely focused on health care access 
and quality, and the neighborhood and built environment. Most focused on developing interventions to improve health care 
access and quality or characterizing neighborhood risk and individual risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Given that few interventions addressed economic stability, education access and quality, or community context 
and social risk, the potential for harnessing social determinants of health data to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease 
remains unrealized.
Key Words:  cardiovascular disease ■ data-driven interventions ■ health equity ■ hypertension ■ social determinants of health
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause 
of morbidity and mortality across the world, ac -
counting for 32% of deaths worldwide.1 In the 
United States alone, CVD accounts for 659 000 annual 
deaths, and costs the nation $219 billion each year.2 
Key risk factors for CVD include high blood pressure, 
high cholesterol, and smoking, with other medical 
conditions and lifestyle choices such as diabetes, 
obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, and excessive 
alcohol use increasing one’s risk.2 Nationwide, 7% of 
men and 4.2% of women have CVD, with the highest 
prevalence among adults ≥75 years of age.3 Racial and ethnic disparities in CVD are also well documented.4 
Moreover, the risk incurred by low socioeconomic sta -
tus alone is comparable to traditional risk factors.5
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) and the American Heart Association have 
identified the need to address social determinants of 
health (SDOH) in both public health and in health care 
delivery efforts to close these gaps between popu -
lation groups.6,7 Furthermore, practicing clinicians 
have called for the integration of SDOH, big data, and 
technology to address CVD disparities, specifically 
calling for an integration that must reach beyond the

McNeill et al Addressing CVD and Health Equity With SDOH Datahealth care system and into the community and pa -
tients’ homes.8–11 According to the CDC, there are 5 
SDOH domains that must be addressed to improve 
health: economic stability, education access and qual -
ity, health care access and quality, neighborhood and 
built environment, and social and community context.7 
Social and community context includes the existence 
of discrimination, which is a threat to health among 
racial and ethnic minority communities.12 Further re -
search has linked the effects of these domains to CVD 
outcomes.5,8–11,13–21Despite the literature documenting the association 
of SDOH and CVD outcomes, efforts to address SDOH 
have been hindered by lack of knowledge about how 
SDOH compounds problems of access and treatment, 
as well ways in which SDOH may be practically ad-
dressed. A major obstacle for addressing these issues 
has been an absence of strategies to harness data 
about SDOH to drive interventions, especially because 
data may come from many different sectors.22
The goal of this scoping review is to assess what 
types of SDOH data are being used to reduce the bur -
den of CVD and how these data are being applied. 
Previous reviews have examined the role of SDOH on 
influencing CVD outcomes; however, these reviews 
have been limited to specific SDOH domains (such as 
housing instability and food insecurity, or education 
and income) and have not examined the all SDOH fac -
tors that influence health in 1 review.23,24 Other reviews 
have focused on a wide range of SDOH, yet either 
lacked focus on CVD or only evaluated single method-
ological approaches to analyze data.25,26 This review 
addresses these gaps in evidence by focusing on the 
ways in which SDOH data have been applied to im -
prove CVD outcomes, largely in the United States but 
also in other high-income countries.
METHODS
Search Strategy
Search terms for each of the 3 domains of inter -
est, social determinants of health, data, and CVD, 
were used to retrieve abstracts from PubMed, Web 
of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
Health Literature, Ovid/Embase, Cochrane, and 
Scopus. Search terms for each of the areas of interest 
included both the domain (eg, social determinants of 
health) as well as Medical Subject Headings  and other 
terms related to these domains (eg, social environ -
ment, social inequality, living environment). Following 
the World Health Organization’s definition of CVD, we 
included search terms that included heart and blood 
vessel disorders, and health conditions and complica -
tions that are strongly associated with CVD such as 
diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, myocardial 
infarction, and stroke.1 Although not a systematic re -
view, this review conforms to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses pro -
tocol for scoping reviews.27 Database searches were 
conducted on March 11, 2022, with results exported 
to the Covidence application.28 In all, >60 terms were 
entered, with searches modified as needed for each 
database. In regard to the American Heart Association 
Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines on 
data sharing and study materials, no original data were 
produced by this scoping review; however, all search CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
What Is New?
• Previous reviews have examined the role of so -
cial determinants of health (SDOH) influence on 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes; how -
ever, these reviews have been limited to specific 
SDOH factors and have not examined all SDOH 
domains in 1 review.
• Reviews on a wide range of SDOH factors 
lacked focus on CVD outcomes or focused on 1 
approach to using big data to address CVD out -
comes or health equity (such as solely reviewing 
applications of artificial intelligence algorithms), 
rather than exploring the range of approaches.
• This review addresses these gaps in evidence 
by examining what and how data across sectors 
are being used to address social determinants 
of health to improve equity in CVD outcomes.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• This review discusses the ways in which SDOH 
data may be applied in clinical settings, as many 
studies discussed in this review are performed 
within a clinical or hospital setting, and link 
electronic health record data with SDOH data 
to generate health equity reports, construct 
patient care plans, form risk scores for clinical 
decision making, and improve patient self-man -
agement of CVD outcomes.
• The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated un -
derlying disparities in health care, and patients 
who have contracted COVID-19 are at a higher 
risk for CVD, indicating the importance of apply -
ing the findings of this review to address these 
developing needs.

Eligibility Criteria
We use the definition for CVD put forth by the World 
Health Organization, which defines CVD as heart and 
blood vessel disorders, and includes health conditions 
and complications that are strongly associated with 
CVD such as diabetes, high cholesterol, hyperten -
sion, myocardial infarction, and stroke.1 The decision 
to include data from different domains was based on 
the recognition that multiple factors affect health out -
comes.29 This review only included studies located in 
high-income countries, as categorized by the World 
Bank.30 The search results were limited to studies 
published in 2014 and onward, because health care 
providers were required to demonstrate meaningful 
use of electronic health records (EHRs) by January 1, 
2014 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act.31,32 At this time, there was a similar movement 
across the European Union. In 2013, the European 
Commission released a major report urging health 
care providers across the European Union to increase 
adoption of EHRs, and improved adoption was dem -
onstrated over the next 5 years.33,34 We excluded all 
studies with a study population <18 years of age and 
those in languages other than English. Editorials, com -
mentaries, systematic reviews, conference abstracts, 
conference proceedings, methods articles, reviews, 
qualitative studies, articles discussing treatment pro -
tocols, and those intended to validate tools or software 
applications were also excluded.
Screening and Study Selection
Inclusion criteria included studies that (1) contained 
data related to SDOH; (2) contained outcomes related 
to CVD; (3) included data from ≥1 of the SDOH do -
mains as outlined by the CDC framework; (4) were lo -
cated in high-income countries, as categorized by the 
World Bank30; and (5) were limited to studies published 
in 2014 to 2022, because US health care providers 
were required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHRs 
by January 1, 2014 under the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act, and a similar movement across the 
European Union was happening at the same time.31–34 
Articles must have been published between January 
2014 and March 2022. Exclusion criteria included (1) 
studies with a study population <18 years of age and 
(2) those in languages other than English. Also ex -
cluded were editorials, commentaries, systematic re -
views, conference abstracts, conference proceedings, 
methods articles, reviews, qualitative studies, articles 
discussing treatment protocols, and those intended to validate tools or software applications. The Figure  sum-
marizes the screening and study selection process.
Data Extraction
We extracted results from included studies, and the fol -
lowing categories were extracted: authors, year, study 
purpose, and SDOH domain addressed by the study. 
The following additional categories were extracted: 
outcomes, outcome measures, data sources, and 
main findings. CVD-related results included outcomes 
(eg, stroke, hypertension) and outcome measures (eg, 
blood pressure values considered to be hypertension). 
Other information extracted included the data source 
(eg, health claims data, transportation data), how the 
data were being used or applied (eg, use of data to 
create vulnerability maps), and the time period cov -
ered by the data sources used. We also extracted the 
method or algorithm applied (eg, deep learning, ma -
chine learning) and the limitations/barriers to the data 
identified (eg, missing data). Notably, we excluded co -
variates from the data extraction.
RESULTS
A complete extraction table of the studies may be 
found in Table  S1.35–84 The study characteristics are 
summarized in Table  1, the SDOH domains addressed 
by each study are summarized in Table  2, and the pri -
mary uses of the SDOH data among each study are 
summarized in Table  3.
Study Characteristics
Table  1 outlines the characteristics of the studies 
selected for this review. The majority of studies ana -
lyzed were published in the years 2020 (n=8) and 
2021 (n=8). Most articles studied populations within 
the United States (n=40), and New York City was the 
most common geographical location within the United 
States (n=8). Twelve studies were in nations outside 
the United States.
Common settings were uses of data within the 
hospitals (n=26), neighborhoods (n=13), and pri -
mary care practices (n=11). Populations of interest 
were health care users within a specific health care 
system (n=31). The second most common popula -
tion was residents within a specific geographic area, 
such as residents of specific states or cities (n=19). 
Most studies used a cross-sectional study design 
(n=17), retrospective cohort studies (n=13), and geo -
graphical and spatial analysis (n=12), whereas less 
common study designs included case studies (n=3), 
clinical trials (n=3), and randomized control trials (n=2). 
Thirty-three studies used linear or logistic regres -
sion methods,35,37–42,46–48,51,52,54,56–60,62,64–66,69–78,80,81

McNeill et al Addressing CVD and Health Equity With SDOH Dataand 14 studies applied spatial analysis to under -
stand the relationship between SDOH and CVD out -
comes.35–38,45,50,53,54,58–61 Machine learning, including 
data mining, gradient boosting machine, extreme gra -
dient boosting, phase type random forests, Breiman’s 
random forest, support vector machine, and tree-
based classification were used in 4 studies.52,72,73,75
Six types of outcomes were investigated. The most 
common outcomes studied were cardiac outcomes, 
such as acute heart events (n=13) and chronic dis -
ease (n=33). Thirty-one studies characterized patient 
lifestyles, 14 studies investigated decision-making 
improvement strategies, and 4 studies investigated 
patient management of CVD ( Table  2). Thirteen 
studies examined acute heart events such as heart 
attack, stroke, hospitalization, readmission, and 
ejection fraction changes.36,38,40,45,50,53,54,59,63–65,73,79 
Thirty-three studies investigated chronic heart dis -
eases such as high blood pressure, chronic heart 
disease, atherosclerotic CVD, and medication adherence.35,41–44,46–48,51,52,55–58,60–62,67,68,70–72,74–78,80,84 
Four studies investigated CVD mortality.37,39,49,66
SDOH Domains Addressed by Each Study
Table  2 summarizes the SDOH domains ad -
dressed in these studies and the uses of the data. 
The most common SDOH domain among the ar -
ticles retrieved was health care access and qual -

the neighborhood and built environment.35,46,49,52–61 
Four studies measured economic stability as their 
primary domain.38,62,65,68 Eleven studies addressed 
2 SDOH domains, focusing on a combination of the 
economic stability, health care access and qual -
ity, or neighborhood and built environment do -
mains.37–39,45,49,58,62,64,73,75,76 One article addressed

McNeill et al Addressing CVD and Health Equity With SDOH DataUses of SDOH Data
Table  3 summarizes the primary uses of SDOH data 
to address CVD outcomes and health equity. Data 
measuring an SDOH domain were used for 3 main 
purposes: neighborhood characterization, risk calcula -
tion, and intervention development ( Table  3).
Uses of SDOH Data to Characterize 
Neighborhoods
Unsurprisingly, SDOH data have been used to un -
derstand the relationship between the built environ -
ment and CVD outcomes. Twenty-seven studies 
used data to characterize neighborhoods. The most 
common sources of data were EHRs that were used 
to describe prevalence or incidence of CVD risk fac -
tors and outcomes at the neighborhood level. Data 
were used to understand the health status of neigh -
borhoods, including barriers to health that individuals within a neighborhood may face. Pharmaceutical dis -
pensing data and health literacy data harnessed in 1 
study helped researchers identify distribution patterns 
and disparities in CVD medication dispensing within 
a neighborhood.43 Specifically, this study mapped 
these data to reveal neighborhoods that had lower ac -
cess to pharmacies and were unable to dispense the 
necessary CVD medications for self-management.43 
Data about the neighborhood and built environment 
were collected to create climate vulnerability maps 
that could impact CVD outcomes (n=2): 1 for heat-
extreme events35 and another for heat-extreme events 
and flooding.49 One study applied EHR data to identify 
health care access patterns among veterans in New 
York City after a hurricane,41 whereas another study 
analyzed the effects of perceived spatial stigma (for 
example, feeling social judgment for living in a low-
income area) on CVD outcomes among individuals 
who live in an urban setting.51 Additional studies (n=2) Table 1. Study Characteristics

McNeill et al Addressing CVD and Health Equity With SDOH Dataevaluated the association of air pollution and CVD55 or 
identified the health effects of highway-adjacent hous -
ing.57 Police data, state health survey data, census 
data, and EHR data have been combined to identify 
the characteristics that influence CVD within a de -
fined neighborhood.46 Researchers applied spatial 
analysis (n=10) to identify access to emergency care 
and to applied health scores to identify risk within 
neighborhoods.36,37,44,45,50,53,54,58,60,61
Data have been used to understand the relationship 
between disease burden and the built environment. 
Three studies applied EHR data to New York City 
neighborhoods that experience higher chronic disease 
burden.42,47,48 Specifically, hospital administrative data, 
emergency department data, and EHR data were used 
map public health surveillance (n=2) so that health care 
providers and policy makers could identify CVD health 
risk among neighborhoods.47,48 One study observed 
the use of a regional health registry and identified the 
disparities within neighborhoods.40 Health adminis -
trative data, census data, and food environment data have been compiled to create a county-level CVD risk 
score.39 Three studies used social media X (formerly 
Twitter) data to characterize chronic conditions within 
a neighborhood and Google View satellite images to 
identify the neighborhood characteristics associated 
with CVD outcomes,52,56,61 whereas another evaluated 
the spatial relationship between neighborhood disad -
vantage and major atherosclerotic CVD-related events 
to understand spatial risk of CVD.38
Use of SDOH Data for Risk Calculation
Fifteen studies used data about ≥1 SDOH domain to 
evaluate risk scores that measure social risk. One study 
recalibrated the Veterans Affairs cardiac risk score, and 
found that EHR data are best for CVD risk prediction 
in comparison with the established risk score.74 One 
study created an SDOH score (including covariates 
such as educational attainment, health literacy, stress, 
living arrangements, social isolation, census-based 
income, and ethnicity), and the Framingham Risk 
Score (a commonly used risk score to predict CVD 
over 10  years).70 Administrative claims data, labora -
tory data, and demographic data were used to create 
a mortality risk score,63 and 1 study determined that 
adding SDOH data strengthened a CVD risk predic -
tion score.64 Data were used to create a new measure 
of CVD risk that included allostatic load to understand 
the effects of racism on CVD.76 One study used the 
Protocol for Responding To and Assessing Patients’ 
Risks, Assets, and Experiences tool to evaluate patient 
SDOH needs (self-reported data on SDOH such as 
lack of housing, unemployment, and access to medi -
cine or health care) to further understand the associa -
tion between cardiometobolic risk and SDOH.62 One 
study assessed the predictive power of a risk score 
for carotid artery stenosis.71 Two studies assessed the 
Area Deprivation Index’s ability to predict CVD risk,65,66 
whereas another evaluated the impact of health infor -
mation technology on CVD risk prediction.69
Artificial intelligence has been applied to inform 
clinician and policy decision making on CVD risk, Table 2. SDOH Domains Addressed to Improve

appropriate treatment of multiethnic patients and 
improve health care access, Sarraju et  al applied 
machine learning techniques to create a 5-year pre -
diction model of CVD among such patients using 
neighborhood location data.72 Ye et al applied ma -
chine learning and EHR data to predict the incidence 
of hypertension within 1 year in 1.5 million Maine res -
idents using socioeconomic indicators.75 An addi -
tional study applied the Familial Hypercholesterolemia 
Case Ascertainment Tool algorithm to describe risks 
of familial hypercholesterolemia (and resulting isch -
emic heart disease) among ethnically diverse pop -
ulations using prescription data as indicators for 
health care access.67 One study applied machine 
learning to predict CVD hospital readmissions using 
environmental risk.73
Use of SDOH Data for Intervention 
Development
Eight studies described intervention development to 
improve CVD outcomes by incorporating SDOH data. 
EHR data and health care administrative data have 
been used to create a health care registry to improve 
data interoperability, allowing researchers, policy mak -
ers, and health care providers to track health care de -
livery and identify disparities in health care access at 
the regional level.84 One study linked a digital health 
application to EHRs to address health care access by 
improving medication adherence to health literacy and 
CVD outcomes,83 whereas another used a different 
application to improve patient self-management of hy -
pertension by providing a coach to help patients better 
understand physician instructions.82 A third study pro -
vided health education to community members by of -
fering community-based education and screening for 
dental care and hypertension to improve health literacy 
and self-management of CVD.81 One study evaluated 
racial disparities in health care and used SDOH data 
on patients’ cultural, racial, and ethnic beliefs and 
background to generate clinician reminders to discuss 
hypertension with patients to improve self-manage -
ment.80 Similarly, clinical and health registry data on 
health care access and quality have been accessed to 
provide primary care practices with health equity re -
ports.77 One study linked patient EHRs, self-reported 
patient SDOH data (such as primary language at 
home), and a bidirectional community intervention e-
referral portal, allowing health care providers to refer 
patients to community-based interventions based on 
patient need and receive feedback on patient pro -
gress.78 Finally, 1 study constructed an application 
that analyzed patient reported outcomes (mental and 
social well-being data) to generate individualized CVD 
care plans.79DISCUSSION
This scoping review has examined 3 broad domains 
of data, social determinants of health, and CVD. 
Numerous studies have demonstrated the associa -
tion between CVD and the 5 SDOH domains: eco -
nomic stability,5 education access and quality,18,19,85 
social and community context,20 health care access 
and quality,21 and the neighborhood and built environ -
ment,17 and practicing clinicians have called for the 
use of big data on SDOH to address CVD and health 
equity.8–11 This review identified 50 articles that have 
used SDOH data to address these outcomes. SDOH 
data have been used to address health outcomes, 
yet gaps in research and application exist. Although 
many studies used multiple sources of data to ad-
dress SDOH and cardiovascular outcomes, by and 
large, the studies used similar data sources, including 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision 
and Tenth Revision (ICD-9 and ICD-10 ) codes from 
geocoded EHR data (n=33), national survey responses 
and census data (n=17), and data focused largely on 
health care access and equity. Overall, studies that ad-
dressed the domain of health care access and qual -
ity,37,39,42,44,45,58,63,64,72–75,77–79,84 and neighborhood and 
built environment46,52–56,60 were found to successfully 
predict or improve CVD outcomes. Studies that de -
veloped individual risk scores relied almost exclusively 
on EHR or health administrative data (n=4). For exam -
ple, Ye et al calculated risk using EHR data to create a 
risk prediction model of incident hypertension, but did 
not draw on other data sources.75 Additionally, Nobel 
et al created an Index of Cardiometabolic Health using 
EHR data.76 A growing body of literature has indicated 
that a variety of data sources are needed to capture 
constructs that cannot be described by a single data 
source.86–88 Although EHR data provide clinical infor -
mation, details on other SDOH factors (such as food 
security or socioeconomic status) are not captured. 
Additionally, multiple sources of data are needed to 
limit bias.86 For example, EHR data only capture those 
using the health care system; as a result, those with -
out access are likely underrepresented. Despite calls 
for improved integration of multiple SDOH from poli -
cymakers, clinicians, and researchers, only a handful 
of studies examined the role of economic stability and 
social and community context. Although many stud -
ies included race and ethnicity, and educational at -
tainment as covariates, no studies primarily focused 
on the SDOH domains of racism or education access 
and quality.
Occasionally, studies drew from a wide range of non-
health sector data including transportation data, police 
data, and retail data. For example, 1 study performed 
by Kihal-Talantikite et al in Strasbourg, France assessed 
the neighborhood influences on the spatial distribution

McNeill et al Addressing CVD and Health Equity With SDOH Dataof myocardial infarction.53 To understand a neighbor -
hood’s access to greenspace, this study integrated data 
on health care systems; transportation; greenspace and 
public parks; athletic equipment and facilities from city 
sports programs; civic and community environments; 
local businesses; the educational environment; ven -
dors, such as alcohol and tobacco stores; and land use 
and land coverage.53 These sources were combined 
with EHR data to create maps to assess the neighbor -
hood influences on the spatial distribution of myocar -
dial infarction.53 However, such uses of multisector data 
sources were rare, suggesting an untapped potential 
to combine a wide array of data sources to examine 
SDOH, specifically within the United States.
Although many studies used race as a covariate or 
stratified populations by race, there is an absence of 
attention to racism, which has been found to be a de -
terminant of health.12 The studies captured here add 
to the growing body of research documenting health 
disparities among racial and ethnic minorities, but fall 
short of exploring the role of racism as a determinant 
and as a mechanism for explaining those disparities. 
More research is needed to measure and examine 
the role racism plays as a driver of cardiovascular 
health inequities, because the burden of CVD is higher 
among the Black population.4 Similarly, although stud -
ies commonly include educational attainment as a co -
variate, the domain of education access and quality is 
a different construct, one not well measured by edu -
cational attainment. Although some studies examined 
health literacy, this construct is also different from ed-
ucation access and quality, and is part of the health 
access and quality SDOH domain according to the 
CDC.29 This review identified 3 objectives in the use of 
data to address SDOH and improve CVD outcomes: 
neighborhood characterization, patient risk calcula -
tion, and intervention development. Efforts to calculate 
patient risk sought to incorporate the SDOH domains 
of health care access and quality and economic sta -
bility, whereas intervention development was limited to 
addressing health care access and quality. Efforts to 
characterize neighborhoods primarily focused on the 
SDOH domains of health care access and quality, as 
well as the neighborhood and built environment to ad-
dress CVD outcomes. This is unsurprising, given that a 
core mission of health care systems is to provide health 
care intervention to improve population, or at least, pa -
tient health outcomes. However, health care providers, 
policymakers, and researchers should consider efforts 
to better understand and develop interventions that 
address the SDOH domains of neighborhood and built 
environment, economic stability, education access 
and quality, and social and community context, be -
cause these also affect health care access and qual -
ity. Although health care systems may view domains 
such as education or economic stability as beyond their mission, the literature is clear that these social de -
terminants of health impact health outcomes. Health 
care systems should continue to screen patients for 
needs, offer SDOH support services, and refer them 
to community support to meet the needs under the 
other domains.
Notably, in the United States, several recent federal 
policy initiatives are aimed at supporting the collection 
and analysis of SDOH data.89 In their new strategy for 
the Accountable Care Communities Model, which aims 
to assess the health-related social needs of beneficia -
ries, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation 
requires new participants to both collect and report on 
data related to SDOH.90 As part of their Uniform Data 
System Modernization Initiative, the Health Resources 
and Services Administration has allocated $90 million to 
support data-driven approaches for Federally Qualified 
Health Centers to identify and address health inequity, 
which includes the collection of patient-level SDOH data 
beginning in 2023.89,91 Additionally, the Office of the 
National Coordinator for Health Information Technology 
aims to advance the use and interoperability of SDOH 
data within EHR systems through a variety of initiatives; 
this includes developing policies to address SDOH 
data interoperability, supporting states in building EHR 
systems for SDOH data, and helping integrate SDOH 
data into provider workflows.89,92 These initiatives open 
up opportunities to address some of the gaps identi -
fied in this review including the use and integration of 
multiple sources of SDOH data from a broad range of 
sectors. In 2018, Europe established the Joint Action on 
Health Information, a project funded by the European 
Commission, to strengthen health system performance 
assessment and population health monitoring.93 A simi -
lar policy implemented in the United States could include 
data from all 5 SDOH domains and improve assessment 
and monitoring of health initiatives across the nation.
In comparison with other published reviews, this re -
view offers a review of all 5 SDOH domains in relation 
to CVD in the literature. Previous reviews focused on 
CVD have only addressed 1 to 2 specific domains.23,24 
Khaing et al established the connection between ed-
ucation, income, and CVD, but did not explore use 
of SDOH data.23 Parekh et al studied the connection 
between food insecurity, housing instability, and CVD, 
but did not investigate the use of SDOH data to ad-
dress these domains.24 This review has determined the 
different ways SDOH data have been applied to ad-
dress all 5 SDOH domains. Other reviews have evalu -
ated a wide range of SDOH domains, yet lacked focus 
on CVD outcome or only examined specific methods 
(such as machine learning).25,26 Kino et al found that 
the application of machine learning to understand 
SDOH has relied upon traditional methods such as 
surveys.25 Zhao et  al found that machine learning is 
able to incorporate complex SDOH data across all 5

McNeill et al Addressing CVD and Health Equity With SDOH Datadomains.26 This review, however, has a broader scope, 
including studies that apply different types methods to 
understand all 5 SDOH domains.
Like all studies, this study has limitations. Our ex -
clusion of non-English articles may have resulted in 
missing important studies; however, given our focus 
on high-income countries, we expect this limitation to 
have had minimal impact on our analysis. SDOH are 
understood differently by different audiences; there-
fore, studies that included SDOH beyond those in the 
CDC framework may have been missed.29 Additionally, 
our decision to exclude articles published before 2014 
may have resulted in missing some relevant studies. 
Finally, articles that focused on the validation of tools or 
applications were eliminated; to the extent that the val -
idation methods focused on interventions not reported 
elsewhere, these may have been missed.
CONCLUSIONS
Data from each SDOH domain can be used to ex -
press the state of health among a population, allow -
ing a multidimensional look into the everyday lives of 
a neighborhood, a population, or place. The wide -
spread availability of data across sectors can provide 
a sharper understanding of the health needs at hand. 
Future research should focus on addressing additional 
SDOH domains, such as education access and qual -
ity, and social and community context, and must in -
clude measures of racism. Given the widening health 
disparities in the United States, now is the time to har -
ness big data and new analytic tools to address health 
equity and improve CVD outcomes.
