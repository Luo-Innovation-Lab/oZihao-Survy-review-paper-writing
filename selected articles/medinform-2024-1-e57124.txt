Abstract
Background: Social determinants of health (SDOH) are critical drivers of health disparities and patient outcomes. However,
accessing and collecting patient-level SDOH data can be operationally challenging in the emergency department (ED) clinical
setting, requiring innovative approaches.
Objective: This scoping review examines the potential of AI and data science for modeling, extraction, and incorporation of
SDOH data specifically within EDs, further identifying areas for advancement and investigation.
Methods: We conducted a standardized search for studies published between 2015 and 2022, across Medline (Ovid), Embase
(Ovid), CINAHL, Web of Science, and ERIC databases. We focused on identifying studies using AI or data science related
to SDOH within emergency care contexts or conditions. Two specialized reviewers in emergency medicine (EM) and clinical
informatics independently assessed each article, resolving discrepancies through iterative reviews and discussion. We then
extracted data covering study details, methodologies, patient demographics, care settings, and principal outcomes.
Results: Of the 1047 studies screened, 26 met the inclusion criteria. Notably, 9 out of 26 (35%) studies were solely concen-
trated on ED patients. Conditions studied spanned broad EM complaints and included sepsis, acute myocardial infarction,
and asthma. The majority of studies (n=16) explored multiple SDOH domains, with homelessness/housing insecurity and
neighborhood/built environment predominating. Machine learning (ML) techniques were used in 23 of 26 studies, with natural
language processing (NLP) being the most commonly used approach (n=11). Rule-based NLP (n=5), deep learning (n=2),
and pattern matching (n=4) were the most commonly used NLP techniques. NLP models in the reviewed studies displayed
significant predictive performance with outcomes, with F1-scores ranging between 0.40 and 0.75 and specificities nearing
95.9%.
Conclusions: Although in its infancy, the convergence of AI and data science techniques, especially ML and NLP, with
SDOH in EM offers transformative possibilities for better usage and integration of social data into clinical care and research.
With a significant focus on the ED and notable NLP model performance, there is an imperative to standardize SDOH data
collection, refine algorithms for diverse patient groups, and champion interdisciplinary synergies. These efforts aim to harnessJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Abbott et al

Introduction
Medical care, while crucial, contributes to only about 20%
of the modifiable factors influencing a population’s health
outcomes, while 80% are influenced by genetics, individual
behaviors, and socioeconomic factors. The latter two form
the social determinants of health (SDOH) [ 1] that operate
at various levels. From macroeconomic policies of nations
to public education and housing policies, these structural
factors shape resource distribution and societal positions.
Consequently, they influence living conditions, access to
essential resources, and daily life circumstances, ultimately
molding health and health disparities [ 2]. Every patient’s
health trajectory is influenced by SDOH, which can manifest
positively (eg, high income, food security) or adversely [ 3].
The negative aspects can be categorized into social risks,
conditions linked to poor health, and social needs, which
are individual preferences for assistance [ 4]. These determi-
nants, especially when adverse, can hinder optimal care and
impact clinical outcomes [ 5]. While not the focus of this
review, health-related social needs reflect individual level
social needs, and are inextricably related to the impacts and
conditions of SDOH.
Emergency medicine (EM) is a unique medical specialty:
it can both identify and address adverse SDOH, making it a
pivotal setting for intervention. The high prevalence of social
needs among emergency department (ED) patients, especially
those with low socioeconomic status, housing insecurity, or
limited access to care, underscores the potential of ED-based
SDOH interventions [ 6,7]. However, there are significant
challenges; comprehensive social risk screenings in the ED
are often impractical due to patient volume, acuity, and health
system financial constraints. Relying solely on electronic
health records (EHRs) is time-consuming and inconsistent.
Furthermore, the scattered and unstructured nature of SDOH
data in EHRs makes it difficult for ED physicians to identify
patients with adverse SDOH [ 8-10]. However, advancements
in techniques in the data sciences provide novel methods to
address these issues.
Social informatics, a subfield of medical informatics,
refers to the usage of information technology to better
harmonize social and health data through improved capture
and usage. It bridges the gap between the technical and social
worlds, offering insights into how technology and societal
factors interplay. The vast possibilities of social informatics
lie in its potential to reshape how we understand, interpret,
and act on social data in health care settings. By integrating
social data with health data, it aims to enhance clinical care
and overall health outcomes [ 11]. Techniques like natural
language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), andmachine learning (ML) are being harnessed to extract, use,
and model SDOH data effectively [ 12-14 ]. AI represents an
umbrella term that broadly encompasses computer systems
that can achieve human-level performance on cognitive tasks
[15], while NLP, a subfield of AI, is a field of computational
linguistics that involves analyzing and understanding human
language. This entails using a combination of statistical
approaches, including ML, to extract structure and meaning
from language [ 16]. Pertinent to this review, ML can also
be used as an analytic technique for predictive modeling and
better understanding patterns in data sets.
While  existing  literature  has touched  upon  SDOH  in
the ED, a comprehensive  review  focusing  on the appli-
cation  of data sciences  in this context  is lacking.  This
scoping  review  aims  to map the current  literature,  pinpoint
areas  for future  research,  and highlight  the transformative
potential  of integrating  data sciences  into EM SDOH
research.
Methods
Data Sources and Literature Search
Strategy
To capture the evolving role of AI and advancing data science
techniques for patients seen in the ED, particularly pertaining
to SDOH, we searched the literature from 2015 to 2022,
a period marked by rapid advancements in AI applications
in health care. We included articles from databases such as
Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Web of Science,
and ERIC, prioritizing research that melded data science with
emergency care settings.
Our search encompassed terms related to SDOH, data
science techniques such as ML algorithms, NLP, AI, and
EM (see Multimedia Appendix 1  for search terms used). We
chose to include EM patient populations to best understand
this clinical context. While there is no uniform definition
for data science, for this review we have used the defini-
tion proposed by Mike and Hazzan [ 17] that considers data
science as a research method by “integration of research
tools and methods taken from statistics and computer science
that can be used to conduct research in various application
domains, such as social science and digital humanities”.
Article Selection
We focused our review on studies leveraging data science
techniques to extract or model SDOH data in EM. Recog-
nizing the paucity of EM-specific research using AI/ML
algorithms, we also considered studies on emergency-rela-
ted conditions that might be seen in other clinical non-ED
settings. This included conditions such as opioid use disorderJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Abbott et al

(OUD), HIV, and epilepsy. We intentionally excluded
COVID-19 studies, given their unique characteristics and
sheer volume of literature. This exclusion ensured a more
focused review with current relevance. Two independent
reviewers (DA and EA) assessed titles and abstracts for
final inclusion. Any disagreements were resolved through
joint discussions. We used Covidence (Covidence systematic
review software; Veritas Health Innovation), a standardized
systematic review software.
Data Extraction
We extracted data from the selected studies using a stand-
ardized form, ensuring uniformity. We captured study
objectives, methods, clinical care setting, ML algorithms,
modeling approaches, and specified outcomes (see Multime-
dia Appendix 2 ). We focused on broad data science techni-
ques, including subfields of AI such as ML algorithms, NLP
key SDOH domains, and overall clinical outcomes. Whileour focus remains descriptive, we abstained from a quality
assessment, aligning with standard scoping review guidelines.
Results
Overall Study Characteristics
After screening 1047 studies, 26 met our final inclusion
criteria ( Figure 1  and Multimedia Appendix 1 ). We excluded
a significant number of studies because they did not focus
on EM conditions or complaints and did not use AI/ML
techniques in the overall approach to the study question.
Most studies were published after 2020 ( Figure 2 ) and
included patient populations focusing exclusively on the ED
(n=9), pediatric patients (n=2), patients treated by emergency
medical services (n=2), and US veterans (n=2), among other
examples.JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Abbott et al

SDOH Domains
Over 60% of studies we identified (n=16) used a broad array
of data science techniques such as ML or NLP to use, model,
or extract features across more than one of the major SDOH
domains, resulting in significant overlap across publications
included in this review ( Figure 2 ). These domains included
housing insecurity and homelessness, neighborhood and built
environment, income and socioeconomic status, employment,
family and social support, food insecurity, insurance status
and stability, and history of incarceration. While individual
level SDOH data was the prevalent unit of analysis, 5 studies
used area level data or aggregated measures such as the
Social Deprivation Index, Area Deprivation Index, or the Gini
coefficient. Housing insecurity and homelessness emerged
as the most predominant SDOH domains assessed among
23% of the studies identified (n=6). The domain of neighbor-
hood and built environment was also present across multiple
studies and the focus of several publications (n=4). Exposure
to or history of incarceration (n=2) as well as OUD (n=2)
were also notable.Exploration of Emergency Medicine
Conditions
The scope of EM clinical conditions and complaints that
were studied were broad, including sepsis, acute myocar-
dial infarction, heart failure, asthma, diabetes, chest pain,
and epilepsy ( Multimedia Appendix 3 ). Sepsis was the only
specific EM condition we identified in more than one study
(n=2). Several studies focused on all-cause ED revisits (n=2),
“preventable visits” and admissions (n=2), and ED utilization
(n=2).
AI and ML Algorithms
AI techniques were used in 23 studies, encompassing
methods like random forest, classification and regression
trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and NLP
(Figure 3  and Table 1 ). Of these, random forest emerged as
the most common (n=13), closely followed by NLP (n=11).
Key algorithms are discussed in further detail.JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Abbott et al

aSDOH: Social Determinants Of Health
Random Forest in SDOH Variable
Classification and Data Management
Random forest, an advanced ensemble ML method, was
notably present across multiple studies identified in this
review. This technique was used to discern and highlight
pivotal SDOH variables. Its ability to create predictive
models, offering foresight into potential health trajectories
based on the subtleties of SDOH indicators was also evident.
For example, in “Improving Fairness in the Prediction of
Heart Failure Length of Stay and Mortality by Integrating
Social Determinants of Health,” the authors used random
forest classifiers on sex, ethnoracial, and insurance for study
subpopulations, finding differences in underdiagnosis and
overdiagnosis of heart failure [ 18]. The most common use
of random forest, however, was to address missing EHR
data through imputation, ensuring the integrity and robustness
of analyses. Beyond its analytical capabilities, it was also
used to create insightful visual representations, offering acomprehensive view into the intricate web of variables, their
interactions, and their overarching impact on disease states
like acute coronary syndrome, epilepsy, asthma, and OUD.
NLP for SDOH Data Extraction
The integration of NLP in the realm of EM offers a promis-
ing avenue for the precise extraction of SDOH from EHRs.
Traditional methodologies, such as manual reviews and
rudimentary keyword searches, are increasingly recognized
for their inherent limitations, particularly in the context
of vast and intricate EHR data sets. Our scoping review
elucidated the prevalence of several NLP techniques in
the field. Text representation methods like term frequency-
inverse document frequency (n=4), Bag of Words (n=3), and
Word2Vec (n=1) were prominently used, underscoring their
fundamental role in converting textual data into computation-
ally amenable formats ( Figure 4 ). In the realm of topic
modeling and semantic analysis, latent Dirichlet allocationJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Abbott et al

(page number not for citation purposes)

was noted in 2 studies, highlighting its potential in discern-
ing latent topics within medical records. Approaches favored
rule-based methodologies, found in 5 studies, followed by
deep learning (n=2) particularly structures like bidirectional
long short-term memory and pattern matching (n=4). From
a software perspective, both proprietary (n=5) and open
source (n=6) tools were harnessed, reflecting the diverse
ecosystem of NLP tools available for research. These NLP
methodologies, especially the dominant ones like Bag ofWords, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and
deep learning structures, have demonstrated notable efficacy.
However, to achieve the pinnacle of precision in SDOH
data extraction, it is imperative to continually refine these
NLP techniques. Collaborative endeavors involving domain
experts, iterative model training, and the assimilation of
multifaceted data sources are paramount to enhancing the
accuracy and relevance of extracted insights.

health (SDOH), term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) .
Health Information Exchange (HIE) for
SDOH Data Aggregation
Health information exchange (HIE), featured in 4 out of
26 studies ( Figure 5 ), aggregates patient data across health
care entities, providing a comprehensive view of a patient’s
clinical journey. With 40% of patients in one study having
encounters at multiple organizations, the importance of HIEin reflecting the distributed nature of ED care becomes
evident. HIE can aid in analyzing care transitions and
augmenting the sample size and diversity for SDOH research.
However, challenges like data sharing, data quality, and
privacy regulations need to be addressed. In essence, HIE
holds immense potential for EM research, offering both
multi-organizational and community-level insights.JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Abbott et al

Predictive Applications
ML techniques can be important tools to leverage for clinical
outcome predictions, and we identified a significant number
of studies in our review. A total of 19 studies, representing a
diverse array of ML strategies were identified, each tailored
for distinct predictive outcomes. The efficacy of predictive
models was a pivotal outcome in 10 studies. Performance
metrics for these models, when used as a primary outcome,
showcased a range of F1-scores from 0.4 to 0.75, indicat-
ing varied precision and recall across studies. These ranged
from supervised models like random forest classifiers for
acute coronary syndrome predictions to neural networks
targeting sepsis-related readmission risks. Notably, ensemble
methods were adeptly used to discern primary risk factors
for OUDs. Within this realm, NLP proved instrumental,
particularly in classification tasks, risk stratification, and
fortifying clinical decision-making processes. Beyond this,
key outcomes highlighted patterns in ED revisits (n=6),
in-hospital mortality (n=2), algorithmic bias (n=1), and
mismatches between physician annotations and claims data
(n=1).
Data Quality, Privacy, and Algorithmic
Bias
In the comprehensive spectrum of studies analyzed, an
intriguing observation surfaced: a noticeable gap in the
examination of data quality and privacy concerns within the
realm of SDOH and EM. Despite sifting through a multitude
of research articles, we did not encounter any study that
directly tackled these pivotal issues. This omission underlines
the potential vulnerabilities in the application of AI and
ML techniques, especially when handling sensitive patient
data. Furthermore, a singular study broached the topic of
algorithmic bias, a topic of paramount importance given thepotential repercussions on health care outcomes and equity.
The underrepresentation of these themes hints at unchar-
ted territories that warrant meticulous exploration in future
research endeavors, ensuring that the integration of AI and
ML in EM is both robust and ethically sound.
Discussion
Principal Findings
The leveraging of SDOH data within EM research and
clinical care is pivotal for gaining new insights, improving
patient outcomes, and optimizing health care delivery. Our
scoping review highlights the transformative role of data
science, chiefly AI/ML, and the subdiscipline of NLP, in
improving SDOH data integration and modeling within EM.
Emerging from our review is an increase toward using
data science to harness, operationalize, and model SDOH in
emergency care settings. This progression signifies a shift:
a pivot toward a comprehensive, data-infused approach that
addresses not just emergent conditions but also the intri-
cate web of social and economic determinants impacting
health. NLP excels at extracting SDOH information from the
unstructured text of EHRs, while ML’s predictive strength
can transform these insights into actionable predictions. Such
models, equipped with SDOH data, can catalyze precision
interventions, potentially identifying mechanisms for ED
revisits, in-hospital mortality, and readmissions.
Delving deeper into the SDOH domains, housing
insecurity and the neighborhood environment emerged as
primary determinants, witnessing significant attention across
the studies. Their frequent appearance in the research
landscape underscores their profound impact on health
outcomes within emergency settings. While these domains
were at the forefront, other determinants like education,JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Abbott et al
https://medinform.jmir.org/2024/1/e57124 JMIR Med Inform 2024 | vol. 12 | e57124 | p. 8
(page number not for citation purposes)

employment, and social networks were also featured, albeit
to a lesser extent. The emphasis on these SDOH domains,
especially housing insecurity, suggests a pressing need
for targeted interventions and policies within emergency
care settings. As the health care sector continues to
evolve, understanding these predominant SDOH domains
and harnessing the power of data science will be pivotal in
offering a more holistic, patient-centric approach to emer-
gency care.
Our comprehensive review, while offering insights, bears
certain limitations warranting acknowledgment. The time
frame for our study, confined to 2015-2022, captures most
contemporary advancements but might inadvertently omit
foundational studies predating this period, potentially offering
evolutionary insights. While we highlighted NLP and other
ML techniques, the vast expanse of data science boasts other
emerging tools such as the recent and rapid development of
large language modeling (LLM) such as ChatGPT (OpenAI),
which were absent in our review. The potential applications
of LLM in harnessing and modeling SDOH within the EM
setting are rapidly emerging and will likely expand the
possibilities for improving health outcomes and disparities.
Second, the encompassing scope of our review, spanning
diverse SDOH domains and emergency conditions, enriches
the study’s comprehensiveness. Yet, the scope also poses
challenges in distilling specific conclusions regarding the
utility of data science techniques across distinct SDOH or
EM conditions. Comparative analysis across studies was
hampered by the varied outcome measures adopted. Although
a significant number focused on the performance of predic-
tive models, this only scratches the surface of data scien-
ce’s potential impact on SDOH within EM. Lastly, our
review refrained from assessing the methodological quality
of the incorporated studies. This approach aligns with scoping
review guidelines but omits considerations of each study’s
methodological soundness during our synthesis.
Amidst these intricacies and challenges, there are still
other pressing concerns. Data quality, privacy concerns, and
algorithmic biases are potential hurdles that merit attention.
In particular, the limited exploration and assessment of
algorithmic bias in our reviewed studies, given its poten-
tial to perpetuate health care disparities, suggests an urgent
avenue for further investigation. Without careful assessment
of algorithmic biases, there exists the potential for reinforcing
racial and ethnic discrimination and institutional racism. Only
one study we identified in our review specifically assessed
ML model bias and fairness in the context of heart failure
outcomes [ 18]. ML algorithmic biases are critical to address
in the context of SDOH research, as prior studies have
demonstrated the potential for reinforcement of pre-existing
racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities [ 19].
Future Works and Recommendations
Potential Areas of Exploration
Our review has illuminated the significance of certain
domains like housing insecurity, within the context ofSDOH in EM. However, the vast landscape of SDOH offers
numerous other domains that remain relatively unexplored:
1.Education:  Investigating the role of educational
attainment and access to quality education can provide
insights into its impact on health outcomes. For
instance, understanding how literacy levels influence
patient adherence to medical advice in emergency
settings could be pivotal. AI techniques could be used
to better understand the complexity of both current
educational attainment and future or desired educational
needs through careful extraction or modeling of data.
2.Employment:  Employment status, job security,
economic mobility, and workplace conditions can
have profound effects on mental and physical health.
Exploring these factors can shed light on stress-related
conditions or injuries that present in EDs.
3.Social  networks:  The influence of social support
systems, community engagement, and familial ties
can play a crucial role in patient recovery and men-
tal well-being. Delving into these aspects can offer
a holistic view of a patient’s environment and its
implications for health.
With these potential areas in mind, it becomes evident that
a multi-faceted approach to SDOH within EM is the way
forward. Building on these areas of exploration, we propose
several recommendations to harness the full potential of
SDOH in EM.
Recommendations
1.Establishing  gold standard  metrics:  For the evolution
and standardization of emergency SDOH research, it
is essential to define and adopt gold standard metrics.
These metrics should be robust, universally accep-
ted, and tailored to capture the nuances of SDOH
in emergency settings. Collaborative efforts among
researchers, clinicians, and policy makers should be
made to create these benchmarks.
2.Innovative  data  capture and  implementation:  The
high-paced nature of emergency settings necessi-
tates innovative solutions for capturing SDOH data.
Leveraging AI-assisted tools or predictive algorithms
based on existing patient data could offer one approach.
Creating automated workflows to allow for capture and
implementation of SDOH data at the patient encounter
level will be important for addressing social risks and
needs.
3.Algorithmic  innovation:  The prominence of ML and
NLP in our findings suggests a horizon brimming with
algorithmic advancements and adaptation for EM. As
these tools evolve and new tools emerge, crafting and
evaluating interventions tailored to specific SDOH is
crucial.
4.Connecting SDOH with  clinical  outcomes:  Beyond
identifying SDOH, understanding their tangible impact
on patient outcomes is vital. A concerted effort in
this direction can revolutionize our care approach.
The intersection of SDOH and clinical outcomes is
recognized by the Centers for Medicare and MedicaidJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Abbott et al
https://medinform.jmir.org/2024/1/e57124 JMIR Med Inform 2024 | vol. 12 | e57124 | p. 9
(page number not for citation purposes)

Services, which requires health care systems to screen
for key SDOH domains.
5.Interdisciplinary  collaboration:  The confluence of
expertise, from clinicians to data scientists, will be
instrumental in harnessing the full potential of SDOH
data.
6.Addressing  algorithmic  bias:  As we increasingly rely
on algorithms, it is imperative to ensure they are free
from biases that could perpetuate or exacerbate health
disparities. Rigorous testing, validation, and refinement
of algorithms, with a focus on fairness and equity,
should be prioritized.
Conclusions
This scoping review underscores the transformative potential
of data science in elevating the understanding and application
of SDOH within EM. Through the adept integration of data
science methodologies, particularly ML and NLP, we are
poised to redefine the way SDOH data is adopted within EM.
This offers a broader and more data-informed approach to
influencing critical patient outcomes. The literature landscape
indicates a promising embrace of this cross-disciplinary
synergy, manifesting in an increasing number of studies
that deploy data science methodologies to unearth, interpret,
or model SDOH within emergency care contexts. Such atrajectory not only affirms the growing acknowledgment of
these methodologies’ efficacy but also underlines the health
care sector’s commitment to delivering more holistic care.
Nevertheless, our review also pinpoints avenues that
warrant deeper exploration. Despite the expansive focus on
various SDOH domains, certain determinants like housing
insecurity and the neighborhood environment have gar-
nered disproportionate attention. A more balanced explora-
tion across SDOH domains would provide a richer, more
comprehensive insight into their collective and individual
impacts on patient trajectories. Moreover, while the current
trend leans heavily on ML and NLP, there exists a vast
expanse of data science techniques yet to be fully leveraged
like LLM. Diving into these untapped methodologies might
further refine our capabilities in SDOH identification and
intervention.
In conclusion, the fusion of data science with EM marks
the dawn of a new health care epoch. It envisions a future
where EDs transcend their traditional roles, evolving into
hubs that address the foundational SDOH challenges within
communities. As we navigate this promising trajectory, the
potential to revolutionize EM and fortify patient-centric care
is immense.
