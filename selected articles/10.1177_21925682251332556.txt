Abstract
Study Design: Retrospective cohort.
Objective: Despite numerous studies highlighting patient comorbidities and surgical factors in postoperative success, the role
of social determinants of health (SDH) in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) outcomes remains unexplored. Thisstudy evaluates the predictive impact of SDH on 90-day readmission and health utilization (HU) in ACDF patients using machinelearning (ML).
Methods: We analyzed 3127 ACDF patients (2003-2023) from a multisite academic center, incorporating over 35 clinical and
demographic variables. SDH characteristics were assessed using the Social Vulnerability Index. Primary outcomes included 90-day readmission and postoperative HU. ML models were developed and validated by the area under the curve (AUC) forreadmission and mean absolute error (MAE) for HU. Feature importance analysis identi ﬁed key predictors.
Results: Balanced Random Forest (AUC = 0.75) best predicted 90-day readmission, with length of stay, Elixhauser score, and
Medicare status as top predictors. Among SDH factors, minority status & language, household composition & disability,socioeconomic status, and housing type & transportation were in ﬂuential. Support Vector Regression (MAE = 1.96) best
predicted HU, with perioperative duration, socioeconomic status, and minority status & language as key predictors.
Conclusions: Findings highlight SDH ’s role in ACDF outcomes, suggesting the value of stratifying for interventions such as
targeted resource allocation, language-concordant care, and tailored follow-up. While reliance on a single healthcare system andproxy SDH measures are limitations, this is the ﬁrst study to apply ML to assess SDH in ACDF patients. Further validation with
direct patient-reported SDH data is needed to re ﬁne predictive models.

Introduction
Health encompasses physical, mental, and social well-being,
all of which are in ﬂuenced by Social Determinants of Health
(SDH). These components are vital for physicians to provide
equitable and culturally competent care while delivering high-quality healthcare.
1Key aspects of SDH include education,
healthcare access, geographical location, and economicconditions, which collectively contribute to health disparitiesamong different demographics. Evidence shows that thesefactors affect patient outcomes across various medicaldisciplines.
2,3In orthopaedic surgery, SDH in ﬂuences out-
comes in surgeries involving the hand, shoulder, and joints.4,5
Moreover, key elements such as housing, transportation, in-
surance, language, disability, and socioeconomic status areneeded to further understanding the impact on spine surgery.
6
Nonetheless, there is a notable gap in research regarding theimpact of SDH on spine surgery.
Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a
workhorse approach for treating symptomatic cervical disease
and is one of the most commonly performed spine proce-
dures.
7ACDF has been shown to alleviate pain and disability,
and overall has lower complication rates compared to otherspine surgeries.
8,9However, given the increasing volume of
ACDFs performed nationwide, there is a lack of under-standing regarding speci ﬁc drivers of complications. While
studies have linked various comorbidities to postoperativesuccess, little is known regarding the impact of SDH on
cervical spine surgery.
As with any large dataset, including SDH-related char-
acteristics alongside clinical and surgical parameters presentschallenges for data analysis due to the increasing number ofvariables. Machine learning (ML) offers considerable ad-vantages in managing complex datasets, identifying patterns,and making accurate predictions. Unlike traditional statistics,which rely on preprogrammed rules and assumptions, ML
algorithms learn based on the data provided and generate
improved models over time.
10It should be noted that ML is
not intended to replace traditional statistics but rather harnessits predictive ability as another tool in a clinician ’s decision-
making toolbox.
ML has been applied to ACDF populations, focusing on its
application and impact on clinical outcomes.
11-14To sum-
marize, patient demographics /C0such as age, obesity, and ASA
classi ﬁcation/C0are amongst the most predictive factors.
Moreover, prior research has established the 90-day postop-erative period as a meaningful time point for evaluating bothcost and surgical outcomes, with admission rates ranging from5-13%.
15,16To our knowledge, no prior study has incorpo-
rated a broad range of SDH variables. By integrating thesefactors, our study provides a more comprehensive under-
standing, offering insights that may aid clinicians in risk
mitigation and targeted intervention strategies /C0ultimately
reducing cost and improving patient outcomes. The primaryobjective of this study is to predict 90-day readmission rates,as well as overall health utilization (HU) using an extensive
array of demographic, clinical, surgical, and SDH variables inACDF patients. The secondary objective is to evaluate theimpact of SDH-related factors impact on ACDF outcomes,providing further evidence of their clinical signi ﬁcance.
Methods
Adult patients who underwent single or multilevel ACDF for
degenerative cervical disease at a multi-center academichealth system between 2003-2023. Patients were identi ﬁed
from the electronic medical record (EMR) using NorthwesternMedicine Enterprise Datawarehouse, with data extractionbeing classi ﬁed using standardized current procedural ter-
minology (CPT) codes for information collection. To mini-
mize selection bias, only patients with completed informationbelow and follow-up data were included in the ﬁnal analysis.
A total of 40 clinical variables, including demographics
(age, sex, body mass index [BMI], etc.), past medical history(American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] class, Elix-hauser Comorbidities score, etc.), past medication history(antibiotic, neuromodulator [gabapentin, pregabalin, etc.],
benzodiazepine), past surgical history, total perioperative
duration (de ﬁned by the total time spend in the operating room
[OR], total surgery time from incision to closure, and totaltime under anesthesia), postoperative complications, 30-dayreadmission, and 90-day readmission were included. Patientswere excluded if they underwent surgery for malignancy,trauma, infection or if key clinical variables were missing.Data inconsistencies were managed by performing periodic
chart reviews and cross-referencing EMR records for accu-
racy. If discrepancies could not be resolved, the patient wereexcluded from the analysis.
The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was used to assess
SDH at the census tract level. SVI scores were derived fromthe U.S. Census Bureau, which provides validated demo-graphics metrics. The Geocodio platform was utilized to as-sign patient addresses to census tracts, ensuring alignment
with census tract boundaries. The SVI ranks each tract based
on 15 social factors (i.e., poverty, lack of vehicle access, andcrowded housing). These factors are grouped into four sub-domains: socioeconomic status, household composition, mi-nority status and language, housing type and transportation.Each sub-domain is scored from 0 to 1 at the census tract level,with higher scores re ﬂecting greater social vulnerability. The
overall SVI score is computed by summing the sub-domain
scores and normalizing them to percentile ranking. To validate
the SVI assignment, the values were cross-referenced with theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a publiclyavailable geographic dataset.
The primary outcomes were 90-day readmission and
postoperative HU. 90-day readmission is de ﬁned as any in-
patient admission within 90 days of ACDF. HU was calculatedas the sum of all emergency department or urgent care visits,
invasive procedures (including cardiac catheterization, IVC2 Global Spine Journal 0(0)

placement, and laryngoscopy), non-routine testing (e.g.,
electromyography), and non-routine imaging (computed to-mography, magnetic resonance imaging) in the ﬁrst 90 days
after surgery.
Statistics
Data was analyzed using RStudio v. 2024.12.0 + 467 (RStudioPBC Boston). Statistical analysis was completed to showcomparison between readmission vs non-readmission groups.A sub-analysis was conducted between single vs multi-levelfusions. Differences between groups were detected using thestudent ’sttest for means and chi-squared test for categorical
variables. A P-value of <0.05 was considered signi ﬁcant.
Machine Learning
ML models were run using custom Python scripts and were
validated by the area under the curve (AUC) for a 90-dayreadmission and mean absolute error (MAE) for HU. The datawas split into training/testing sets. An 80/20 train-test split wasselected as it provides a balance between training the model on
sufﬁcient data while reserving enough unseen data to evaluate
generalized performance. This proportion is commonly usedin ML studies to ensure model robustness while preventingoverﬁtting. Validation was performed on withheld test data
following optimization. For 90-day readmission, ExtremeGradient Boosted Tree Classi ﬁer (XGBoostC), Balanced
Random Forest (BRF), Elastic-Net Penalized Logistic Re-gression (ENet), and Deep Learning Neural Net (DNN) were
used given the categorical nature of the outcome. Alterna-
tively, Extreme Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor(XGBoostR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Re-gression (SVR) were used for HU as a continuous type ofoutcome. The algorithms were selected based on their strengthin handling structured clinical data, prevalence within thecurrent literature, ability to manage class imbalance andnonlinear relationships.
To further mitigate over ﬁtting, hyperparameter tuning was
performed using Bayesian Search Algorithm over 15 itera-tions and across 5-fold cross-validation. This optimizationcriteria were model speci ﬁc: mean AUC was used for clas-
siﬁcation models (XGBoostC, BRF, ENet, and DNN) and
mean MAE for regression models (XGBoostR, RF, SVR). Thebest-performing hyperparameters were selected based onthese respective metrics. Tuned hyperparameters varied by
model but included learning rate, tree depth, and number of
estimators, among others. Furthermore, inverse classweighting based on frequencies were used to address classimbalances. This approach ensured robust parameters selec-tions while minimizing over ﬁtting and avoiding data
imbalance.
The DNN model was created using Sequential API
(Tensor ﬂow Keras) library with an input layer connecting to a
deeper connected layer, dropout layers to prevent over ﬁtting,and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function.
Similarly, hypertuning and inverse class weighting were usedbased on previously mentioned methods.
The best-performing models were determined by the
highest mean AUC and lowest mean MAE. Feature selectionwas not conducted prior to model development; all featureswere included in training/testing to allow the models to au-tonomously determine relevant predictors. This approach was
chosen to avoid potential bias from arbitrary feature exclu-
sions and to ensure no potentially important variables wereomitted before model optimization. Feature importance wasevaluated using SHAP values to understand the relativecontribution of each feature. Additionally, the whole processwas repeated 50 times to ensure randomness was preserved,given the repeated data partition throughout the analysis.Feature importance plots were created based on the best-
performing models. Standard deviations were calculated for
AUC and feature importance. A histogram was created ofsome of the top predictors for 90-day readmission and HU. AllML models were run using their respective implementations inPython: scikit-learn, shap, Tensor ﬂow, and Keras packages.
Results
A total of 3127 patients met the inclusion criteria and were
included in our sample, with demographics shown in Table 1 .
The average age was 55.9 years (SD 12.0). Our cohort had aslightly higher number of males (50.2%), multilevel fusions(65%), and ASA class of either 1 or 2 (56.3%). The 30-day and90-day readmission rates were 7.1% and 9.8%, respectively.The comparison analysis showed a signi ﬁcant differenceTable 1. Demographic for ACDF Cohort.

found that minority status & language, housing type &
transportation, socioeconomic, household composition &disability, and overall SVI value in the top 20 most importantfactors for predicting readmission ( Figures 1 and2). Other top
predictors included length of stay (LOS), Elixhauser score,
and Medicare status. The mean HU score was 5 ± 3 with SVRperforming the best for health utilization (MAE 1.96 ± 0.07,Table 3 ). Socioeconomic status, minority status & language,
and household composition & disability were amongst the top20 predictors of HU ( Figures 1b and2). Additionally, total
perioperative duration variables —deﬁned by total operating
room (OR) time, total surgery time (incision to closure), and
total time under anesthesia —were the top predictors for HU
following ACDF. Besides the similar SDH variables that werefound to be important towards the predictability of bothmodels, other overlapping features between the two outcomesincluded age, LOS, ASA Class 2, postoperative neuro-modulation use, BMI, insurance status (i.e., Medicare), bothElixhauser and MFI-11 scores ( Figure 1(a) and (b) ). To further
illustrate the racial and ethnic breakdown of our cohort, we
included a histogram of the Minority Status & Language
variable ( Figure 3 ).
Discussion
SDH are recognized for their in ﬂuence on patient ’s health
beyond conventional clinical parameters. These factors, suchas minority status and education, have been shown to sig-niﬁcantly in ﬂuence both clinical outcomes and patient lon-
gevity.
17In recent years, the application of ML in predicting
surgical outcomes has increased. While traditional statisticsare crucial for understanding linear relationships throughhypothesis testing, ML excels at capturing complex patterns
over large datasets while adapting new data to predictoutcomes more accurately. ML has been applied in various
ﬁelds to improve the decision-making between clinicians and
patients, with practical applications such as predicting read-mission for heart failure patients.
2Several studies have uti-
lized ML in predicting surgical outcomes in ACDFpopulations; however, no prior study has conducted an in-
depth analysis of SDH ’si nﬂuence on 90-day readmission or
HU using ML.
12,14,18
In this study, several ML models were utilized to predict
90-day readmission and HU in ACDF patients. BRF per-formed the best for predicting 90-day readmission, achievingan AUC of 0.75. SVR produced the best MAE of 1.96 for HU(Table 3 ). These results, as previously mentioned, likely re ﬂect
BRF’s ability to handle class imbalance while enhancing
discriminative power, and SVR ’s strength in capturing
complex, non-linear relationships with robust outliers.
19
Feature importance analysis revealed that, besides SDHfactors, other clinical variables such as LOS and total peri-operative duration were among the top predictors for both 90-day readmission and HU. Additionally, some of these pre-dictors were reinforced by the ﬁndings of our comparison
analysis for 90-day readmission with factors such as LOS,
Elixhauser score, insurance, age, BMI, ASA class, and
perioperative duration being found to be statistically signi ﬁ-
cant ( Table 2 ). Notably, multiple SVI-related variables, in-
cluding socioeconomic status, household composition &disability, minority status & language, housing type &transportation, and the overall SVI ranking were not found tobe signi ﬁcant using traditional statistics but emerged as im-
portant predictors in our ML model ( Figure 1(a) and (b) ). This
underscores the advantage of ML in capturing complex,
multifactorial relationships that in ﬂuence patient trajectories
beyond isolated variable comparisons, offering a morecomprehensive approach to risk strati ﬁcation.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to assess the impact
of SDH on ACDF outcomes. Our ﬁndings align with other
outcomes research within spine and orthopaedics. A studyexamining minority differences discovered that Hispanic
patients had higher rates of emergency department visits after
lumbar fusion.
20Additionally, one review of patients under-
going spine and other orthopaedic procedures found that 64%of studies reported disparities affecting minorities.
21Our
analysis revealed that housing type & transportation, as well ashousehold vulnerability & disabled populations (increasednumber of young, old, disabled, or single-parent householdmembers), were predictors of 90-day readmission. When
analyzing ACDF outcomes outside of SDH features, our
results are consistent with the current literature. In one studyutilizing a smaller cohort of ACDF patients, several healthcomorbidities –such as pulmonary, endocrine, and GI con-
ditions and age –were highly predictive of 90-day read-
mission.
12Similarly, our study found that Elixhauser score,
MFI-11, and age were top predictors of 90-day readmission.Karabacak et al identi ﬁed age and factors such as preoperative
laboratory values, diabetes mellitus, and current smoker statusTable 3. Model Performance for 90-Day Readmission and Health
Utilization (HU).

Different models were used with 90-day readmission and HU as the outcome
variables. A higher AUC (area under the curve) and a lower MAE (meanabsolute error) indicate a more predictive model. Results are shown as mean± standard deviation (SD) with 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CI). Sensitivity (SN)
and speci ﬁcity (SP) included. The models used were extreme gradient boosted
tree classi ﬁer (XGBoostC), balanced random forest (BRF), elastic-net pe-
nalized logistic regression (ENet), deep learning neural net (DNN), extremegradient boosted tree regressor (XGBoostR), random forest (RF) and supportvector regression (SVR).Reyes et al. 5

as predictors of readmissions and length of stay.22Interest-
ingly, our analysis found ASA class and insurance status weretop predictors of 90-day readmission. ASA class has beencorrelated with ACDF readmission in traditional regressionanalysis.
23Furthermore, a propensity-matched cohort com-
paring Medicare and private insurance patients found lower
readmission rates in the Medicare group, aligning with our
traditional statistics analysis ( Table 2 ).24Contradictory, our
predictive modeling identi ﬁed Medicare status as an impactful
variable for readmission, highlighting its ability to account fornonlinear interactions and complex connections such as dif-ferences in baseline health, care coordination, and post-discharge support. For discharge status, Taylor et al. foundthat non-routine discharge status correlated with readmission
rates, which agrees with our ﬁndings that discharge to acute
inpatient rehab is predictive of readmission.
25While home/
self-care was identi ﬁed as a top predictor, further analysis is
needed to determine whether its presence or absence is apositive or negative predictor. Limited studies examining theeffect of SDH on postoperative HU in ACDF found thatminority status patients were at risk for longer postoperativeLOS and medical complications compared to non-minority
patients, directly contributing to higher HU rates in patients
undergoing spine surgery.
26Das et al. found that higher-
income patients fared better than lower-income patients interms of complications following ACDF.
27Although a direct
comparison was not completed in ACDF populations, ourstudy was consistent with this association. Unsurprisingly, ourstudy found that perioperative duration was the top predictorof HU.
28Longer total perioperative duration leads to higher
risks of postoperative complications and necessitates addi-
tional medical care, thereby increasing HU.29,30A retro-
spective study found higher rates of postoperativecomplications such as thromboembolism, infection, andlength of stay linked to prolonged anesthesia time. Impor-tantly, these ﬁndings highlight an opportunity for clinical
workﬂow integration, where automated ML-based risk
stratiﬁcation tools could be incorporated into EMR systems to
ﬂag high-risk patients preoperatively, allowing for earlier
interventions and tailored postoperative planning. By iden-tifying patients at risk of increased HU or admission, clini-cians could allocate resources more ef ﬁciently, ensuring
appropriate follow-up and patient education.
These SDH-related factors, such as minority status &
language, are likely contributing to poorer outcomes throughmultiple mechanism, including disparities in healthcare ac-
cess, communication barriers, and differences in post-
discharge support. Studies have found that language bar-riers are associated with higher healthcare cost and poorerhealth outcomes.
31Patients with limited English pro ﬁciency
may struggle to fully understand discharge instructions,medication adherence, and follow-up care which increases therisk of complications and subsequent healthcare utilization.
32
Studies have found that language concordance /C0patient and
clinician speaking the same language /C0increases trust andunderstanding while reducing clinician frustration.33,34Im-
plementing target interventions /C0such as SDH screening,
tailored social work support, language-concordantstaff/C0could not only improve patient outcomes but also
optimize resources by reducing preventable readmission andexcess HU, ultimately leading to cost savings for healthcare
systems.
Even looking into lumbar fusion populations, disparities in
postoperative outcomes have been well documented, withhigher rates of pseudoarthrosis and postoperative complica-tions observed in groups with higher social vulnerability.
6,35
However, in a propensity-matched study, authors found no
difference in readmission rates between disparity groups at 30and 90 days, suggesting that traditional statistics may not fully
capture the complexity of these associations. Similarly,Figure 2. Histograms of top predictors for readmission and HU.

perioperative duration in hours. Color denotation of surgery time
(blue bars), OR time (red), and anesthesia time (yellow).Reyes et al. 7

Holbert et al. found no changes in 30-day readmission status
amongst SDH variables.36In contrast, our ML analysis
identi ﬁed multiple SVI-related factors as important predictors
of 90-days. One possible explanation for this discrepancy isthe differing biomechanical and recovery pro ﬁles of lumbar vs
cervical spine surgeries; ACDF patients may require addi-
tional consultation from vascular or ENT for preoperative
evaluation. Furthermore, differences in post-discharge carepathways /C0rehabilitation requirements or mobility limi-
tations/C0may further contribute to observed impact of SDH
factors in our cohort.
This study is not without limitations. Our sample size was
limited following data cleaning, resulting in a lower speci ﬁcity even
for the best model. This indicates that the model had a reduced
ability to accurately predi ct positive outcomes, speci ﬁcally patients
who experienced readmission and HU. Increasing the sample sizein future studies could improve speci ﬁcity and consequently, AUC.
Additionally, the analysis was conducted using data from a singlehealth system, which may limit generalizability to other institutionswith different patient demographics, healthcare infrastructures, andclinical work ﬂows. Future multi-institutional studies could help
validate these ﬁndings in broader patient populations.
Another limitation includes our reliance on proxy measures
to estimate SDH, such as SVI, rather than direct patient re-ported data. While SVI provides valuable insights at a pop-ulation level, it may not fully capture nuanced, patient-speci ﬁc
socioeconomic factors that contribute to health disparities.Additionally, while our analysis accounted for insurancetypes, it did not control for insurance compensation levels,which have been shown to in ﬂuence patient trajectories and
healthcare utilization in spine surgery. Moreover, psycho-
logical and social in ﬂuences, including factors related to
secondary gain, may in ﬂuence patient behavior and post-
treatment outcomes. While out study did not account forthese factors, incorporating direct patient-reported SDHmeasures in subsequent research may improve the compre-hensiveness of future studies. Furthermore, as a retrospectivestudy, this analysis is inherently subject to biases related tounmeasured confounders and coding inaccuracies. The use of
ML in clinical decision making also raises ethical consider-ations, particularly regarding transparency, potential bias inalgorithmic decisions making, and the need for equitablemodel implementation. As ML becomes increasingly inte-grated into healthcare, it is essential to ensure that these tools
are used to enhance /C0not replace /C0clinical judgment while
mitigating risks of algorithmic bias and united disparities incare.
Nevertheless, our ﬁndings are signi ﬁcant as they represent the
ﬁrst reported analysis of the pred ictive effects of SDH in anterior
cervical discectomy and fusion p atients, providing an important
foundation for future research. B y leveraging these clinical and
SDH-related factors, p redictive modeling can help identify high-
risk patients more accurately, e nabling targeted interventions
such as enhanced discharge planning, closer follow-up, andtailored resource allocation to r educe cost and readmission risk.
Future studies can implement questionaries or surveys —such as
the PRAPARE assessment tool —to directly query patients about
a range of SDH characteristics, t hereby eliminating the need for
proxy social vulne rability measures.

Conclusion
Over the last decade, the growing body of literature on SDH
has dramatically increased, supporting these factors as in-ﬂuential in medicine and surgery.
38Several SDH variables
were found to be top predictors of 90-day readmission and HUfollowing ACDF. These ﬁndings underscore the potential
value of integrating SDH assessments into preoperative risk
stratiﬁcation, allowing for targeted interventions such as social
work consultation, language-concordant care, and tailoredpost-operative follow up. Demonstrating the predictive valueof SDH in diverse populations will require prospective, multi-institutional studies to further enhance clinical applicabilityand re ﬁne risk strati ﬁcation models. Additionally, developing
and validating ML-based clinical decision support tools thatintegrate SDH factors could help re ﬁne risk assessment and
improve postoperative care pathways. By further investigating
the intersection between SDH and spine surgery, researcherscan enhance predictive modeling approaches and promotehigh-quality care delivery.
