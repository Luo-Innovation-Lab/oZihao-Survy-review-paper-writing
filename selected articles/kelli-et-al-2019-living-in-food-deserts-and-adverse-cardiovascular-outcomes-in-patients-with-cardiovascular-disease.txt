Background- —Food deserts (FDs), de ﬁned as low-income communities with limited access to healthy food, are a growing public
health concern. We evaluated the impact of living in FDs on incident cardiovascular events.
Methods and Results- —We recruited 4944 subjects (age 64 /C612, 64% male) undergoing cardiac catheterization into the Emory
Cardiovascular Biobank. Using the US Department of Agriculture de ﬁnition of FD, we determined whether their residential
addresses had (1) poor access to healthy food, (2) low income, or (3) both ( =FD). Subjects were prospectively followed for a median
of 3.2 years for myocardial infarction (MI) and death. Fine and Gray ’s subdistribution hazard models for MI and Cox proportional
hazard models for death/MI were used to examine the association between area characteristics (FD, poor access, and low income)and the rates of adverse events after adjusting for traditional risk factors. A total of 981 (20%) lived in FDs and had a higheradjusted risk of MI (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.06 –1.95]) than those living in non-FDs. In a multivariate analysis
including both food access and area income, only living in a low-income area was associated with a higher adjusted risk of MI(subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.40 [1.06 –1.85]) and death/MI (hazard ratio, 1.18 [1.02 –1.35]) while living in a poor-access area
was not signi ﬁcantly associated with either (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.05 [0.80 –1.38] and hazard ratio, 0.99 [0.87 –1.14],
respectively).
Conclusions- —Living in an FD is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events in those with coronary artery
disease. Speci ﬁcally, low area income of FDs, not poor access to food, was signi ﬁcantly associated with worse outcomes. (JA m

Key Words: cardiovascular disease death environment food desert myocardial infarction socioeconomic position
First coined in the early 1990s, the term food deserts
(FDs) identi ﬁes areas where residents have dif ﬁculty
with access to affordable healthy food.1While there is no
consensus on the de ﬁnition of FD in the literature, the US
Department of Agriculture (USDA) currently de ﬁnes FDs asareas with both poor food access and low area income,2
and an estimated 23.5 million people are living in such FDs
across the United States.2,3With the growing interest in
residential “place ”as a determinant of health in the recent
years,4FDs have been increasingly recognized as important
environmental contributors to individual health and as
potential targets of community-level interventions to
improve health outcomes.5,6In the meantime, it is well
established that cardiovascular risk and disease are not
only associated with food choice and dietary intake
patterns of individuals7,8but also in ﬂuenced by their
residential neighborhoods.9–11Thus, a better understanding
of FDs and their impact on cardiovascular risk factors and
disease is imperative not only to improve our epidemiologic
knowledge of cardiovascular disease, but more importantly
to develop effective interventions to target vulnerable,
disadvantaged areas of food resources to improve their
cardiovascular outcomes.
The association between FDs and cardiovascular disease
outcomes still remains understudied. A few studies have
examined the cross-sectional association between foodFrom the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Emory University

environment and cardiovascular risk factors/disease.
Recently, we demonstrated that living in an FD was
associated with unfavorable cardiovascular risk pro ﬁles as
well as subclinical vascular disease in a population without
known clinical cardiovascular disease.12Several other
studies have also shown that food environment was
associated with cardiovascular risk factors, such as obe-
sity,13–15diabetes mellitus,16and hypertension.17,18How-
ever, despite these cross-sectional ﬁndings, no study has
yet directly examined the association between living in an
FD and incident cardiovascular outcomes in a longitudinal
study, which would be essential in establishing the causal
relationship between FDs and cardiovascular disease.
Furthermore, given the heterogeneity in the de ﬁnitions of
FD, an in-depth examination of what aspects of FDs drive
adverse cardiovascular outcomes will be also crucial to
address and elucidate the mechanistic pathways from living
in FDs to cardiovascular outcomes and to help design
effective policies.
Herein, we examined the impact of living in FDs on adverse
cardiovascular events using a cohort of patients with suspected or
conﬁrmed coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated not

cular disease, myocardial infarction (MI), and death, independent
of the traditional demographic and clinical risk factors, but alsoinvestigated which component of FDs, poor access to food or low
income, as de ﬁned by the USDA, is the driver of adverse
outcomes. Given our prior work showing that area income drives
the unfavorable cardiovascular disease risk pro ﬁle and disease
burden,
12we hypothesized that living in an FD would be an
independent risk factor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes,
independent of the traditional risk factors, and it would be largely
driven by the low area income, not the level of access to food.Methods

Study Population
We studied 4944 adults aged ≥18 years with valid residential
addresses from the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank,19a
prospective cohort of patients undergoing cardiac catheter-
ization for suspected or con ﬁrmed CAD at 3 Emory Healthcare
sites in Atlanta, Georgia, between 2003 and 2015. Subjects
with congenital heart disease, heart transplantation, severe
anemia, and cancer were excluded. Participants were inter-
viewed to inquire about demographic characteristics, medical
history, medication use, and behavioral habits as previouslydescribed at the time of cardiac catheterization upon
enrollment.
19Collected variables of interest included age,
sex, race, body mass index (BMI), level of education, and
smoking history, as well as medical history including hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, CAD, heart failure
(HF), ejection fraction, prior MI, prior coronary revasculariza-
tion, and medications. Level of education and smoking history
were obtained through a questionnaire completed by patients.
History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus
were reported by patients and con ﬁrmed by physician
diagnosis. CAD was de ﬁned as angiographic evidence of
luminal stenosis ≥20% of major epicardial vessels on the
index coronary angiography upon enrollment. HF was de ﬁned
by the presence of at least 1 of the following: self-reported
history of HF; physician diagnosis of HF noted in medical
records; International Classi ﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9 ) discharge diagnosis of HF; or ejection fraction <50%.
History of MI and coronary revascularization reported by the
subjects were also veri ﬁed by medical records and ICD-9
diagnostic codes. Medication use was documented based onthe medications being taken at enrollment as well as upon
discharge from their index hospitalizations. Fasting lipid
proﬁle and serum creatinine levels were obtained from their
hospital records at the time of enrollment, and estimated
glomerular ﬁltration rate was calculated on the basis of
creatinine level using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiol-
ogy Collaboration equation.
20The study was approved by the
institutional review board at Emory University (Atlanta, GA).
All subjects provided written informed consent at the time of
enrollment.
Environmental Characteristics

What Is New?
Living in a food desert, de ﬁned as an area of low income and
poor access to healthy foods, is associated with adverse
cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary arterydisease, independent of their traditional cardiovascular riskfactor burden.
The association between food deserts and adverse out-
comes is largely driven by low area income, not poor accessto food.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
Living in low-income neighborhoods is a risk factor for
adverse outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.
Whether community-level or individual-level interventions
will improve outcomes needs to be investigated.

tracts that meet the criteria of having both (1) low income and
(2) poor access to food. According to the Atlas de ﬁnitions, the
criteria for identifying a census tract as low income are from
the Department of Treasury ’s New Markets Tax Credit
program. This program de ﬁnes a low-income census tract as
any tract where the tract ’s poverty rate is 20% or greater, the
tract’s median family income is ≤80% of the statewide median
family income, or the tract is in a metropolitan area and has a
median family income ≤80% of the metropolitan area ’s
median family income. Using established de ﬁnitions used in
the Atlas, poor access to healthy food at the census tract level
is de ﬁned as having a signi ﬁcant number of individuals (at
least 500 people) or share (at least 33%) of the population are
>1 mile from a supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery
store for an urban area or >10 miles for a rural area.
Using the USDA Food Access Research Atlas, we obtained
3 area characteristics for the residential address of each
subject: whether its respective census tract is classi ﬁed as (1)
FD, (2) low income, or (3) poor access to food. A previous
study had investigated the validation of the USDA FD
measures; the USDA FDs were compared with secondarydata sources of food outlets (Dun & Bradstreet and InfoUSA)
across 169 census tracts in South Carolina, and the 2 sources
had 94% concordance, 50% to 65% sensitivity, and 60% to 64%
positive predictive value.
21
In addition, we categorized the residential addresses of
subjects as urban or rural using the Census Bureau ’s
urbanized area de ﬁnitions.2Rural areas were de ﬁned as
sparsely populated areas with fewer than 2500 people,
whereas urban areas are areas with more than 2500 people.
Follow-Up and Outcomes
The cohort was prospectively followed for adverse cardiovas-cular events. Follow-up data were obtained by dedicated
research personnel using phone contact, electronic medical
record review, Georgia vital records, and the Social Security
Death Index. The primary end point of the study was MI
including fatal MI, de ﬁned as death within 28 days of MI
onset, as well as nonfatal MI. The secondary outcome was the
composite end point of death or MI. All death and MI eventswere adjudicated by the committee of physicians blinded to
the data, by reviewing medical records as well as the
aforementioned death certi ﬁcates.
Statistical Methods
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the
cohort were summarized as means (SDs) or median (in-
terquartile range) for continuous variables and frequencycounts (%) for categorical variables. Patient characteristics
were compared between those living in FDs and those notliving in FDs using t tests or Mann –Whitney Utests for
continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical
variables. The same comparison was also performed between
those living in low-income areas versus high-income areas as
well as between those living in areas with poor access versus
adequate access to food.
We performed survival analysis to examine the risk of
adverse events for subjects who lived in (1) FD versus non-FD,
(2) area with low income versus area with high income, and
(3) area with poor access versus area with adequate access.Follow-up time was de ﬁned as the time from enrollment until
1 of the following: death, MI, loss to follow-up, or end of
follow-up. Initially, survival probability was compared between
the 2 groups using Kaplan –Meier curves and log-rank test.
Subsequently, multivariable survival analysis was performed
with adjustment of age, sex, race (black versus non-black),
BMI, level of education (high school or less, some college, or
college graduate), smoking history, as well as medical history
including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia,
CAD, HF, ejection fraction, prior MI, prior coronary revascu-
larization and medication use (aspirin, clopidogrel, statin,b-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/an-
giotensin II receptor blocker) (Model 1). These covariates in
the models were selected a priori to account for baseline
differences of risk factor burden between subjects living in
different areas of an FD, as we have recently demonstrated,
12
and to examine the independent association between living inan FD and outcomes. Because individual household income
was not collected in this cohort, we used education level as a
surrogate for individual socioeconomic status. Previously,education had been shown to correlate with individual
household income and cardiovascular risk factors and
outcomes.
22–24For the primary end point of MI, Fine and
Gray’s subdistribution hazard model25was used while treating
death as a competing risk. For the secondary end point of
death/MI, Cox proportional hazards models were used with
the same aforementioned covariates used for the primary end
point.
In addition, we examined the study end point by including
both area income (high or low) and food access (poor or
adequate) simultaneously as independent exposure variablesin a single model (Model 2), in place of the FD variable. This
was to examine which of the 2 components of FDs are driving
the associations between the outcomes and FDs, if any.
Additionally, we strati ﬁed the cohort into 4 groups, depending
on the permutation of area income (high or low) and food
access (poor or adequate) categories, and compared the
differences in their Kaplan –Meier curves using pairwise log-
rank tests.
In the sensitivity analysis, we examined whether the
association between an FD and adverse outcomes differed
with respect to the presence of prespeci ﬁed covariates by

including the interaction term of FD 9the covariate of interest
(Model 1). The same sensitivity analysis was repeated with
respect to the subcomponent of the FD (low area income or
food access) that was identi ﬁed as the primary driver in the
main analysis on the association between the FD and
outcomes.
Finally, we examined whether living in an FD, poor-access,
or low-income area was associated with the risk of death
following incident MI. Among those with incident MI, the rates
of fatal MI, de ﬁned as death within 28 days of incident MI,
were compared depending on the area characteristics (FD
versus non-FD; low income versus high income; poor access
versus adequate access) using Cox proportional hazard
models.
Throughout the analyses, there were no violations of the
proportional hazards assumption, and P<0.05 was considered
statistically signi ﬁcant. All analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Subjects Characteristics
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the4944 subjects are presented in Table 1. The cohort
consisted of 64% male and 22% black individuals with a
mean age of 64 /C612 years; 43% had a high school diploma
or less, whereas 22% had some college education and 35%
were college graduates. Individuals living in FDs (n =981;
20%) were more likely to be black (31% versus 20%) withless college education, were more likely to be living in
urban areas (77% versus 73%) compared with those who
were not living in FDs, and had a higher prevalence of
hypertension and prior revascularization and higher BMI
(Table 1).
FD and Incident Cardiovascular Outcomes
During a median follow-up period of 3.4 years, 812 patients
(16%) died and 230 (5%) had incident MI (Table 2). In
univariate analysis, patients living in an FD compared withthose not living in an FD had a 46% higher risk of MI
(subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 1.46 [95% CI, 1.08 –1.96];
P=0.013), and a 22% higher risk of the composite outcome of
death or MI (hazard ratio, 1.22 [1.05 –1.43]; P=0.011)
(Tables 2 and 3, Figures 1A and 2A). After adjustment for
the baseline demographics and cardiovascular risk factors as
described in the methods, patients living in FDs compared
with those not living in FDs had a 44% higher risk of MI (sHR,
1.44 [1.04 –1.91]; P=0.020), but the increase in risk for
death/MI was no longer statistically signi ﬁcant hazard ratio,
(hazard ratio, 1.16 [0.99 –1.37]) (Table 3).Food Access and Incident Cardiovascular
Outcomes
The rates of adverse outcomes were also compared between
those living in areas with poor food access and those living in
areas with adequate access (Table 2). Subjects living in areas
with poor access to healthy foods were more likely to beyounger and black, with higher education attainment than
subjects living in favorable food access areas. Interestingly,
subjects living in areas with poor food access had a lower
prevalence of smoking and prior MI, higher high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and were more likely to live in
urban areas (Table S1). However, there were no signi ﬁcant
differences in the rates of adverse cardiovascular outcomes
including MI or death/MI between patients living in areas
with poor and adequate access to healthy foods in both
univariate and multivariable analyses (Tables 2 and 3,
Figures 1B and 2B).
Area Income and Incident Cardiovascular
Outcomes
The cohort was also categorized on the basis of area income.
Patients who lived in low-income areas were more likely to be
younger, female, and black, with lower educational attainment.
They were also less likely to live in urban areas and had higher
prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and
higher BMI as well as higher total cholesterol and low-densitylipoprotein cholesterol levels (Table S1). In univariate analysis,
patients living in low-income areas had a 54% higher risk of
incident MI (sHR, 1.54 [1.19 –2.00]; P=0.001) and 29% higher
risk of death or MI (hazard ratio, 1.29 [1.13 –1.46]; P<0.001)
(Tables 2 and 3, Figures 1C and 2C). After adjustment for the
baseline demographics and cardiovascular risk factors,
patients living in low-income compared with high-income areas
had a 39% higher risk of incident MI (sHR, 1.39 [1.06 –1.83];
P=0.019]) and an 18% higher risk of death/MI (hazard ratio,
1.18 [1.03 –1.35]; P=0.033) (Table 3).
Relationship Between Area Income and Food
Access and Incident Cardiovascular Outcomes
When area income and food access were examined simultane-
ously in the same model with the aforementioned covariate
adjustment, living in low-income areas remained signi ﬁcantly
associated with elevated risk of adverse outcomes, including MI
(sHR, 1.40 [1.06 –1.85]) and death/MI (1.18 [1.02 –1.35]),
independent of food access. On the other hand, living in areas
with poor access to food continued to be unassociated with
adverse outcomes (Table 3, Model 2).
Based on the combination of area income and food
access, 1141 (23%) lived in a high-income, adequate-access

area; 1614 (33%) in a high-income, poor-access area; 1208
(24%) in a low-income, adequate-access area; and the
remainder (981; 20%) lived in an FD (Table S2). The
prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as
age, male sex, black race, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
and smoking habits, generally tended to be similar according
to the income level of the area, not access to food (Table S2).
Similarly, the incident rates of adverse outcomes were similar
among those with similar level of area income, regardless of
access to food (Figure 3, Table S3). For example, theincidence of MI was similar between subjects living in areas
with low income/poor access (FD) and in areas with low
income/adequate access (log-rank P=0.49). Furthermore,
subjects living in a high-income/adequate-access area had
comparable risk of MI to those living in a high-income/poor-
access area (log-rank P=0.55) (Figure 3A). On the other hand,
those living in an FD had a higher risk of incident MI
compared with those living in both high-income/poor-access
and high-income/adequate-access areas (log-rank P=0.002
and 0.039, respectively) (Figure 3A). A similar pattern of

relationship was seen with respect to the secondary end
point of death/MI as well (Figure 3B).
Sensitivity Analysis
The association between living in an FD and the increased risk
of adverse outcomes was similar across the subgroups
strati ﬁed by prespeci ﬁed covariates (Table 4). We also
performed sensitivity analyses with respect to low-income
areas, as they were identi ﬁed as the primary driver of the
association between FD and adverse outcomes in the main
analysis (Model 2). Similar to FD, the increase in risk of
incident MI or death/MI for those living in low-income areas
did not differ across most subgroups strati ﬁed by the same
covariates. However, we found a trend for a greater increase
in risk of MI associated with low-income areas among those
with diabetes mellitus ( P-interaction =0.065) and those living
in urban areas ( P-interaction =0.084) compared with theircounterparts. For the composite end point of death/MI, there
was a trend for greater increase in risk with living in low-
income areas among those without HF than in those with HF
(P-interaction =0.062) (Table 5).
We also examined whether living in FD, poor-access, or
low-income areas was associated with a higher risk of death
following incident MI. Of 230 patients who had MI during the
follow-up, 70 (30.4%) died within 28 days of MI (fatal MI).
Nevertheless, living in an FD, poor-access area, or low-income
area was not signi ﬁcantly associated with the risk of
death within 28 days of the index MI (hazard ratio, 1.07
[0.63 –1.82], 1.18 [0.73 –1.88], and 1.12 [0.70 –1.80], respec-
tively).

its components, area income and food access, on adverse
cardiovascular outcomes. We found that subjects living in FDs
not only had an unfavorable cardiovascular risk pro ﬁle but
also a higher risk of incident MI independent of cardiovascular
risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and education level.
Further analyses of the components of FDs revealed that their
adverse health impact is mainly driven by area income rather
than access to healthy food. To the best of our knowledge,
our study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate the risk of incident
adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with living in an
FD, as currently de ﬁned by the USDA, using a well-
characterized clinical cohort of patients with cardiovasculardisease.
Our ﬁndings substantially augment the current under-
standing of the food environment and its role in cardiovas-
cular disease, by directly demonstrating an independent
association between living in an FD and worse outcomes.
Over the past 2 decades, a growing body of literature has
demonstrated that disadvantaged neighborhoods that are
deprived socioeconomically and/or in their physical/social
resources are associated with an elevated risk of unfavorablecardiovascular risk pro ﬁles
10,26,27as well as incident adverse
outcomes.28–30Similarly, studies also examined factors of
food environment in relation to dietary intake patterns31as
well as cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity,13–15,32
diabetes mellitus,16and hypertension.17,18Yet whether living
in areas with poor food environment, such as FDs, would lead
to adverse health outcomes remains understudied. Recently,
we have demonstrated among those without known cardio-
vascular disease that living in an FD is independently
associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular riskfactors, in ﬂammation, oxidative stress, and arterial stiffness in
a cross-sectional analysis.12Now, by demonstrating that
living in an FD also predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes
including MI and death, independent of the traditional
cardiovascular risk factors and demographic differences, we
highlight that the relationship between FDs and cardiovascu-
lar disease is more likely causal, likely mediated via the
unfavorable cardiovascular risk and disease burden associ-
ated with FDs, and our ﬁnding calls for due attention from a
public policy standpoint to develop strategies to intervene and
improve cardiovascular outcomes in FDs.
Another unique contribution of our analysis is that we
simultaneously examined the 2 crucial components of FDs,
low area income and poor access to healthy food, as de ﬁned
by the USDA, to demonstrate that the association between
FDs and adverse outcomes were largely driven by low area
income rather than access to healthy foods. This ﬁnding
indicates that area income and hence the ability to afford
healthy food was a greater predictor of cardiovascular events
rather than access to healthy foods. Overall, our results
suggest that neighborhood characteristics should be consid-ered in risk assessment of patients, while it can also help to
further explore and tailor appropriate interventions and public
resources to underserved areas.
These results have 3 main implications. First, access to
healthy food may be overridden by income and the ability to
actually purchase healthy food regardless of whether there is
local access to healthy food options. Among those with poor
access, living in an area with high income was clearly
associated with lower incidence of adverse events. On the
other hand, among those living in high-income areas, whether

living in areas with poor or adequate access did not result in
any signi ﬁcant difference in the risk of adverse outcomes.
Therefore, access to healthy food by itself may not signif-
icantly contribute to improved cardiovascular outcomes, and
the relative cost of higher-quality food rather than access may
be a major barrier to healthy lifestyle and choices.33,34As
neighborhood poverty increases, there are fewer supermar-
kets and more grocery stores, convenience stores, and fast
food restaurants, and prices for healthy foods tend to be
higher.35–38Other characteristics of low-income areas such
as social deprivation, lack of cohesion, decreased access torecreational resources, lack of public space, and safety were
not measured in this study but may play an important role in
determining outcomes in these area residents.
39It appears
that these neighborhood attributes are correlated with area
income, which can be the driver for adverse health outcomes,
as demonstrated in our analysis.40,41Thus, simply providing
interventions and resources focused on providing access to
healthy food alone may not be enough to overcome disease
risk, especially as it relates to cardiovascular outcomes.Second, access to healthy food options does not necessarily
encourage people to purchase and engage in healthy eating
behaviors that may decrease cardiovascular disease risk.
Studies on the association of food resources, speci ﬁcally
proximity to food establishments, and cardiovascular risk have
been inconclusive and limited.42,43A study of the Framingham
offspring cohort did not ﬁnd a consistent relationship between
BMI and food access.42Although prior data suggest that FDs
may negatively affect risk factors and health behaviors, more
research is needed to determine how access to healthy foods
inﬂuences healthy behaviors and the types of foods. While
public health advocates would hope that increased access to
affordable and nutritious foods would increase the intake of
those foods, studies have shown that even after healthier food
options are made more widely available in FDs, consumers
often continue to make unhealthy choices based on personal
preferences.44Thus, the role of local food environment
interventions to improve healthy food choices coupled with
providing food access in communities should be discussed.
