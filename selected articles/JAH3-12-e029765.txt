ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Addressing social determinants of health 
(SDoH) may be the next forefront of reducing the enormous burden of CVD. SDoH can be defined as any social, economic, 
or environmental factor that influences a health outcome. Comprehensive evidence of the role of SDoH in CVD is lacking, 
nevertheless. This umbrella review aims to give a comprehensive overview of the role of SDoH in CVD. We searched system -
atic reviews (with or without meta-  analyses) using 8 databases and included review reference lists. Four themes (economic 
circumstances, social/community context, early childhood development, and neighbourhood/built environment) and health 
literacy in the health/health care theme were considered. Seventy reviews were eligible. Despite the quality of the included 
reviews being low or critically low, there was consistent evidence that factors relating to economic circumstances and early 
childhood development themes were associated with an increased risk of CVD and CVD mortality. We also found evidence 
that factors in the social/community context and neighbourhood/built environment themes, such as social isolation, fewer 
social roles, loneliness, discrimination, ethnicity, neighborhood socioeconomic status, violence, and environmental attributes, 
had a role in CVD. SDoH factors without (or with minimal) evidence synthesis for CVD were also identified. In sum, this umbrella 
review offers evidence that SDoH, especially economic circumstance and early childhood development, play a significant role 
in CVD. This calls for the strengthening of nonmedical interventions that address multiple factors simultaneously and the inclu -
sion of SDoH in future CVD risk prediction models.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes 17.9  million 
deaths worldwide annually.1 Between 1990 and 
2019, there was an alarming increase in total CVD 
morbidity and mortality.2 CVD cases increased from 
271 million in 1990 to 523 million in 2019, and CVD mor -
tality increased from 12.1 million to 18.6 million.2 CVD is 
a highly fatal condition; for instance, one person in the 
United States dies because of CVD every 34 seconds.3
There has been increasing recognition that social 
determinants of health (SDoH) significantly contribute to morbidity, mortality, and health inequality.4– 7 According 
to the World Health Organization, SDoH are any situa -
tion or circumstance in which individuals are born, grow, 
live, work, and age.8,9 SDoH can also be described as 
any environmental factor that affects a person’s health, 
quality of life, or the progression of a disease in a com -
plex and interconnected manner.10 There are multiple 
theoretical frameworks for SDoH, such as the World 
Health Organization conceptual SDoH framework,11 
the social-  ecological framework,12 and the Healthy

Teshale et al Social Determinants of Cardiovascular DiseasesPeople 2020 and 2030 frameworks.13,14 According to 
Healthy People 2020 and 2030 frameworks,13,14 SDoH 
are a broad concept and can be classified into 5 main 
domains/themes: economic stability, education ac -
cess and quality, social and community context, neigh -
bourhood and built environment, and health and health 
care domains. Economic stability includes employ -
ment/occupation, income, food insecurity, and hous -
ing instability. The education access and quality theme 
include early childhood development and enrollment 
in higher education. Social support, social capital, so -
cial isolation, loneliness, discrimination, and race and 
ethnicity all fall under the social and community con -
text theme. The neighborhood and built environment 
theme contains neighborhood socioeconomic status 
(SES) and environmental attributes, such as food en -
vironment, conflict, and violence, whereas the health 
and health care theme is defined by access to health 
services, access to primary care, quality of care, health 
insurance coverage, and health literacy.13,14
There are disparities in CVD occurrence and out -
comes as a result of the complex and entangled re -
lationships between SDoH and CVD.15,16 SDoH do 
not necessarily have a 1-  way causal relationship with 
health; they can be considered as upstream factors 
(the causes of the causes).17 For instance, during the 
course of a person’s life, poor social health influences 
a variety of health behaviours, including substance 
abuse, being overweight, and eating poorly.15,18,19 They 
are linked to well- known traditional CVD risk factors 
as well. For example, there is evidence that SDoH are 
related to high blood pressure, inflammation, chronic 
stress, and excess cholesterol.7,19,20 In addition, a lack 
of health literacy and difficulty in accessing medical 
services means that diseases are diagnosed late, 
which can lead to life-  threatening consequences, like 
mortality attributable to CVD.7,21
Numerous systematic reviews and meta-  analyses 
have been conducted, focusing on the roles of specific 
SDoH characteristics in CVD,22– 26 and none of these 
has compared the evidence for different domains of 
SDoH and thus indicated which areas could best be 
targeted for the interventions. Besides, an umbrella re -
view, also called an overview of reviews or a systematic 
review of systematic reviews, gathers data from earlier 
reviews to provide user-  friendly summaries for decision 
makers and, therefore, it is incredibly helpful to put 
the evidence into action.27,28 Therefore, we aimed to provide the first comprehensive overview of the current 
evidence in the role of SDoH in CVD by undertaking an 
umbrella review.
METHODS
The Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of 
Reviews,29 a guideline for overviews of reviews of health 
care interventions, is used for reporting ( Table  S1). The 
protocol was registered in International Prospective 
Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number 
CRD42022346994).
Eligibility Criteria
Participants from the general population, at-  risk popu -
lation groups, or both were included. There were no 
restrictions based on the demographic characteristics 
of participants, such as age and sex.
The exposure of interest for our review was SDoH. 
We first considered the SDoH factors and categoriza -
tions described in the Healthy People 2020 and 2030 
frameworks,13,14 as well as other literature.7,19,30 –  32 As 
CVD occurs later in life, SDoH factors can be concep -
tualized as occurring before and directly contributing 
to CVD. The causal pathway is likely most clear for the 
SDoH in early childhood (specific to early childhood 
SES and adverse events related to abuse, neglect, and 
violence), and for this reason we considered it to be a 
stand-  alone theme.30 There is evidence that economic 
stability and economic development of an individual 
or a society as a whole is correlated with education.32 
Furthermore, according to the American Psychological 
Association,33 education is a measure of the SES along 
with income, social class, and financial security. We 
also followed the guidance of other literature30,31 that 
has incorporated education into the economic stabil -
ity theme, which we retitled economic circumstance. 
Hence, in this review we assessed SDoH under 4 
themes: (1) economic circumstance; (2) social and 
community context; (3) early childhood development; 
and (4) neighbourhood and built environment. In ad-
dition, health literacy, which is considered part of the 
health and health care domain, was considered in this 
review ( Figure  1).
The outcome of interest was composite CVD in -
cidence or prevalence and mortality, as well as sub -
types: coronary artery/heart diseases; ischemic heart 
disease; heart failure; myocardial infarction; atrial fibril -
lation; angina; peripheral arterial disease; cardiomyop -
athy; and stroke ( Figure  1).
Systematic reviews with or without meta-  analyses 
that examined the association between SDoH and 
CVD or CVD-  specific mortality were included. For our 
study, we define systematic review as a systematic re -
view if the article identifies itself as a systematic review Nonstandard Abbreviations and Acronyms

Teshale et al Social Determinants of Cardiovascular Diseasesor meta-  analysis and at least the eligibility criteria, infor -
mation sources (implementing systematic search using 
at least one database), selection process, and data 
collection process from the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic reviews and Meta-  Analyses checklist34 
had to be stated. There were no restrictions based on 
setting/country and study design (systematic reviews 
of both observational and interventional studies were 
eligible). Narrative and literature reviews and abstract- 
only reviews were excluded. The latter was excluded 
only after having first conducted a hand search and 
contacting authors twice (when emails were available) 
to get the published full-  text review.
Search Strategy
Seven databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, 
PsycINFO, the Joanna Briggs Institute Database of 
Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, 
and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) 
were searched from their inception to August 2, 2022. 
Keywords and medical subject headings related to 
SDoH and CVD were searched and used, with the support from a specialist librarian. The detailed search 
terms for the Medline database are found in Table  S2. 
In addition, to ensure that all relevant studies were 
not overlooked, a hand search was conducted using 
Epistemonikos (a systematic review repository),35 and 
reference lists of retrieved articles were checked. We 
did not restrict our search based on the year of publi -
cation and publication language (articles published in 
non- English languages were translated using DeepL 
translator, https://www.deepl.com/trans  lator).
Study Selection and Data Extraction
The identified articles were exported into EndNote X9.3 
and deduplicated before importing into Covidence36 (a 
web- based software for screening and data extraction) 
to screen for eligible articles. Two reviewers (A.B.T. and 
H.L.H.) independently screened articles, and disagree -
ments were resolved by discussion. As calculated by 
Covidence, our proportionate agreement was as fol -
lows: title/abstract, 0.91 (Cohen κ , 0.82); and full text, 
0.79 (Cohen κ, 0.47). After securing the final number 
of studies to be included in our umbrella review, data Figure 1. Conceptual framework indicating the domains of the social determinants of health and

Teshale et al Social Determinants of Cardiovascular Diseaseswere extracted by 2 reviewers (A.B.T. and H.L.H.). 
The Joanna Briggs Institute data extraction tool for 
umbrella review was used, and data related to study 
details, search details, appraisal instruments, and 
analysis were extracted.23
Methodological Quality
The quality of the included systematic reviews was as -
sessed using Assessing the Methodological Quality 
of Systematic Review (AMSTAR) version 2 tool,37 a 
modified version of the AMSTAR tool.38 The AMSTAR 
tool was established to evaluate systematic reviews of 
randomized trials. However, AMSTAR 2 is designed to 
evaluate “systematic reviews that include randomised 
or non- randomised studies of healthcare interventions, 
or both.”37 AMSTAR 2 has 16 items in total, with 7 criti -
cal and 9 noncritical domains. The overall confidence 
was rated as high quality (if the review had no weak -
ness or had only 1 noncritical weakness), moderate 
quality (if there were ≥2 noncritical weaknesses), low 
quality (if the review had only 1 critical weakness with -
out considering noncritical weaknesses), or critically 
low quality (if there were ≥2 critical weaknesses with 
or without noncritical weaknesses). Further information 
about the critical and noncritical domains and the rating 
of the overall confidence is available elsewhere.37 Two 
reviewers (A.B.T. and H.L.H.) assessed independently, 
and disagreements were resolved through discussion.
DATA SYNTHESIS AND STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS
The general characteristics of the included systematic 
reviews with or without meta-  analyses were presented 
descriptively. We narrated our findings qualitatively 
based on themes of SDoH. For systematic reviews 
without meta-  analysis, association between a SDoH 
characteristic and CVD was presented graphically with 
distinct highlighting for the presence, absence, or in -
consistent associations ( Figure  S1). For systematic 
reviews with meta-  analysis, the exposure of interest, 
author and year, number of primary studies that con -
tributed to the meta-  analysis, pooled effect size, and 
heterogeneity (I2) were presented using forest plots 
(Figures  S2 through S8 ).
The overall effects of a specific SDoH characteris -
tic on CVD and CVD mortality were summarized and 
reported. Although we retained the terminology used 
by the authors of the included systematic reviews, we 
grouped CVD outcomes according to the International 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical 
Modification  (ICD- 10- CM), codes39 to increase inter -
pretability. Finally, because of the high heterogeneity 
of the included meta-  analyses, insufficient data, lim -
ited number of meta-  analyses per subtypes of CVD, different effect size measures used, and the necessity 
of considering overlapping articles that was not feasi -
ble in this review, we did not conduct statistical pooling 
and assess credibility of evidence using the preexisting 
criteria.40
Amendments Since the Protocol
Initially, we aimed to assess all domains of SDoH and 
their effect on CVD and CVD mortality. However, the 
health and health care domain was removed, with 
the exception of health literacy, because health care 
quality and accessibility is a broad concept that varied 
between different countries and conditions. Also, the 
theme of education access and quality was amended 
to merge education into the economic circumstance 
theme because it is highly related to economic status 
and to create early childhood development as a stand- 
alone theme.
In the protocol, we stated whether to include system -
atic reviews with or without meta-  analysis. However, 
because there was not enough information to address 
our objective and assess the methodological quality, 
abstract-  only systematic reviews were excluded.
We had the plan to use ASRreview software (a ma -
chine learning tool) for article screening,41 which is help -
ful for screening eligible articles at the title and abstract 
stage only. However, we found Covidence to be better 
for screening eligible studies at the title and abstract 
screening as well as full-  text screening stages. We also 
planned to stratify our findings based on sex and age. 
Unfortunately, there were no reviews specific to chil -
dren/youths (almost all were among adults, and some 
did not report the age group), and almost all reviews 
did not report the findings based on sex. It was also 
difficult to report our findings based on countries, such 
as low-  , middle-  , and high- income countries (as initially 
planned), because reviews have no clear demarcation.
RESULTS
Screening Result
A total of 17 132 studies were identified using the 7 
databases ( Figure  2). After the removal of duplicates 
(n=5867), 11 265 studies underwent title and abstract 
screening, and 286 studies proceeded to full-  text re -
view. Of these, 5 studies42– 46 were translated into 
English because they were published in other lan -
guages. Finally, from database searching, 63 studies 
were identified as eligible. The excluded articles (and 
the reasons for exclusion) at the full-  text screening 
stage are provided in Table  S3. From references of 
the retrieved articles and through conducting a hand 
search using Epistemonikos, we identified an addi -
tional 7 eligible studies.47– 53 Therefore, a total of 70 
studies were included.

Teshale et al Social Determinants of Cardiovascular DiseasesGeneral Characteristics of the Included 
Reviews
Of the 70 reviews, 30 (43%) included a meta-  analysis. 
Ten reviews did not report information about the 
country of the included studies. Of those that did 
report, most of the reviews included studies from at 
least 2 countries. However, 11 reviews included stud-
ies from a single country: 9 reviews from the United 
States,49,50,54–  60 1 review from South Korea,61 and 1 
review from Australia.47 Most (n=39; 56%) of the re -
views were published in the past 5 years, with 24 (24%) 
published in the past 2 years. There were 1,62 3,62– 64 
and 753,62–  67 reviews published before 2000, 2005, 
and 2011, respectively. Nine (13%) of the review au -
thors implemented 1 database search, whereas most 
authors used ≥2. Cohort study design was the most 
frequently used in the primary studies included in each 
review. The general characteristics of the included re -
views are found in Table  S4.
Description of the Identified Reviews per 
Themes of SDoH
Of the 70 reviews identified, the greatest propor -
tion included components of social and community 
context (33%) and economic circumstance (32%), followed by early childhood development (18%) and 
neighborhood and built environment (17%). Few re -
views assessed >1 theme; for instance, 4 reviews as -
sessed both economic circumstance and social and 
community context themes ( Figure  3). The number of 
reviews per each SDoH characteristic is presented 
in Table  1.Figure 2. Flow diagram for selection of studies adapted from the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews flow

Teshale et al Social Determinants of Cardiovascular DiseasesMeasurement of Variables Under SDoH: 
Evidence From the Included Reviews
The methods used to measure the variables under 
each SDoH are summarized in Table  S5. In most of 
the reviews, there was no information about the cut 
points that were used to categorize variables under 
SDoH as high, low, good, or poor, and they likely dif -
fered across primary studies and reviews. Despite 
the different cut points that may exist, for our review, 
we used the categories/terms, such as high and low, 
made by the author of the included reviews.
Outcome Measures
Different reviews reported different CVD outcomes. 
Even a single review could report many CVD sub -
types. For this umbrella review, we used the defi -
nition CVD, or subtype, given by the authors. In 
addition, we included all CVD measurements, in -
cluding self- report, record (such as from hospital 
and death registries), imaging, or diagnosis based on 
clinical examination. If the included review reported 
CVD (either by including at least 2 CVD subtypes or 
without mentioning the subtype), we considered it as 
composite CVD.Assessment of Quality
According to the AMSTAR 2 tool, 77% (n=54) of the 
reviews were identified as critically low quality and 
20% (n=14) of the reviews were identified as low quality 
(Table  S6). Only one review68 was graded as medium 
quality, and one review69 was graded as high quality.
As for the critical domains of the AMSTAR 2 tool, 
only 4 reviews (6%) reported a list of excluded stud-
ies. Sixteen reviews (23%) had a registered protocol. 
A third of review authors (33%) incorporated the risk of 
bias while interpreting or discussing the results of their 
review. Most review authors used a comprehensive lit -
erature search strategy (59%; n=41), and used a satis -
factory technique to assess the risk of bias in individual 
studies (56%; n=39).
For the noncritical domains of the AMSTAR 2 tool, 
only one review70 reported the funding source for the 
included primary studies. In most (84%; n=59) of the 
reviews, the reason for the selection of study designs 
was not explained. Study selection and data extraction 
were conducted in duplicate in only 44% (n=31) and 
25% (n=18) of reviews, respectively. Three-  fourths 
(76%; n=53) of the reviews provide satisfactory expla -
nations and discussion about the heterogeneity ob -
served in the results of the study.Table 1. Number of Systematic Reviews by SDoH Characteristic

Teshale et al Social Determinants of Cardiovascular DiseasesSummary Findings
A thorough narration of the findings is found in 
Data  S1 with additional display of reviews without 
meta-  analyses ( Figure  S1) and with meta-  analyses 
(Figures  S2 through S8 ) separately. Here, we compiled 
and condensed the findings from reviews with and 
without meta-  analysis ( Table  2).
Factors Relating to Economic 
Circumstance and CVD
Composite SES24,42,43,61,71–  75: Lower composite SES was 
associated with a higher risk of composite CVD61 and 
CVD mortality.24 Besides, it was associated with an in -
creased risk of CVD subtypes, like stroke24,73 and mortal -
ity attributable to stroke,71 coronary heart disease,24 heart 
failure,74 heart disease,43 myocardial infarction,24 and 
cardiomyopathy.42 However, the association between 
composite SES with atrial fibrillation was inconsistent.75 
Subjective social status (adjusted for objective statuses) 
was not associated with coronary heart disease.72
Education61,62,71,76–  83: In almost all reviews, lower 
education level was associated with a higher risk of 
CVDs (composite CVD,80,81 stroke, coronary heart dis -
ease,80,81 myocardial infarction,79 and ischemic heart 
disease61,62) and CVD mortality (mortality attributable 
to composite CVD76,80 and stroke71). However, in 2 re -
views,82,83 education was not consistently associated 
with composite CVD83 and atrial fibrillation.82
Income42,61,71,76,77,79–  82: In most of the reviews, lower 
level of income was associated with CVD.42,61,71,77,79,80 It 
was associated with higher risk of coronary heart dis -
ease,80 heart failure,77 myocardial infarction,61,79 cardio -
myopathy,42 stroke (borderline significant),80 and stroke 
mortality.71 Of the 3 reviews that assessed the associ -
ation between income and composite CVD mortality, 
2 reported existence of association,61,80 and the other 
one76 found no association. A low income level was not 
constantly linked to atrial fibrillation.82
Occupation61,62,71,76,77,79,81–  84: Low occupation level 
was associated with a higher risk of composite CVD61,81,84 
and CVD mortality.61,84 Specific to CVD subtypes, occu -
pation was associated with a higher risk of heart failure,77 
myocardial infarction,61,79 ischemic heart disease,62,84 
angina,61 atrial fibrillation,82 stroke,61,84 and stroke mortal -
ity.71 There was no association between lower occupa -
tion and stroke and coronary heart disease in one review 
that assessed the effect in men and women separately.81 
In addition, in one review,83 occupation was not consis -
tently associated with composite CVD.
Job insecurity66,85–  87: There were only a few sys -
tematic reviews assessing job insecurity with CVD, and 
these fell within the ICD-  10- CM code of ischemic heart 
disease. In general, the association between job inse -
curity and coronary/ischemic heart disease was not 
consistent.66,86,87 Only one review reported a modest association between perceived job insecurity and inci -
dent coronary heart disease.85
Homelessness, household instability, or both57,88 was 
associated with a higher risk of composite CVD57,88 and 
composite CVD mortality.57 However, household instabil -
ity was inconsistently associated with stroke57 and was 
not associated with heart disease,57 ischemic heart dis -
ease,57 and mortality attributable to cardiomyopathy.57
Food insecurity57 was associated with an increased 
risk of CVD (composite CVD, coronary heart disease, 
myocardial infarction, and heart failure) and composite 
CVD mortality.
Factors Relating to Social and Community 
Context and CVD
Poor/lack of social support63,66–  68,87,89,90 was associ -
ated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction,66 but 
there was no association with composite CVD68 or CVD 
mortality.67 Furthermore, there were inconsistent rela -
tionships with stroke68,89 and ischemic66,87,9 0/coronary 
heart disease.63,68 In the one review that conducted a 
separate analysis for men and women,90 social sup -
port was not associated with ischemic heart disease.
Loneliness, social isolation, or both25,60,91: High 
loneliness and social isolation were associated with an 
increased risk of stroke.25,60,91 However, there was an 
inconsistent relationship between loneliness and heart 
disease subtypes.25,60,91
Social capital58,92–  94: Low social capital index, mea -
sured by both social network and social cohesion, was 
associated with higher mortality attributable to isch -
emic heart disease94 and coronary heart disease,94 
but not stroke94 and mortality attributable to compos -
ite CVD.93,94 Low social network was associated with a 
higher risk of composite CVD mortality.58 Considering 
CVD subtypes, social network had no association with 
stroke58 and coronary heart disease.58 As for social co -
hesion, perceived social cohesion was not associated 
with stroke and coronary heart disease.58 Moreover, 
fewer social roles were linked to higher composite CVD 
and composite CVD mortality.92
Discrimination56: Lifetime perceived racial discrimi -
nation was associated with a higher risk of composite 
CVD, myocardial infarction, stroke, and angina. It was 
also associated with a higher risk of mortality attribut -
able to composite CVD.
Ethnicity and race42,47,50,51,55,69,75,95–  98: There were 
racial and ethnic differences in CVD and CVD mor -
tality. For instance, mortality attributable to ischemic 
heart disease was lower among Afro-  Caribbean com -
pared with White individuals,98 Hispanic Americans 
had reduced risks of composite CVD, coronary heart 
disease, stroke, and heart failure than White people,69 
and Chinese individuals had a lower risk of coronary 
artery disease compared with White and South Asian

Factors Relating to Early Childhood 
Development and CVD
Lower childhood SES64,65,78,99– 102: Lower childhood 
SES was associated with a higher risk of composite CVD65,102–  104 and stroke78,101,102 in later life. However, child-
hood SES had a less consistent association with coronary 
heart disease,100,102 heart failure,101 and heart disease.99 
As for mortality, lower childhood SES was associated 
with a higher risk of mortality attributable to composite 
CVD,64 stroke,64 and coronary heart disease.64

DISCUSSION
This umbrella review provides a comprehensive over -
view of the current evidence of the role of SDoH in 
CVD, including mortality attributable to CVD. We iden -
tified 70 eligible systematic reviews, of which 30 under -
took meta-  analyses. Overall, there was evidence that 
lower or worse SDoH characteristics in the 4 themes of 
SDoH (economic circumstance, social and community 
context, early childhood development, and neighbor -
hood and built environment) were associated with CVD 
and CVD mortality.
However, our review also identified areas within the 
4 SDoH themes that were understudied and warranted 
further study. In particular, we only identified 2 system -
atic reviews assessing homelessness or household 
instability as well as environmental attributes and their 
association with CVD. In addition, we only identified 
single systematic reviews that assessed the role of 
food insecurity, conflict, or discrimination in regard to 
CVD. We did not also identify any systematic reviews 
that examined the association between health literacy 
and CVD.
Economic Circumstance
This umbrella review provided evidence that economic 
instability is linked with a higher likelihood of CVD and 
CVD mortality. Most reviews reported the detrimental 
influence of composite SES, education, income, oc -
cupation, and homelessness on CVD. Food insecurity 
was also associated with CVD, despite the fact that 
the finding was from a single systematic review. Our 
findings are in line with the Health Evidence Network 
Synthesis Report,112 which revealed that SDoH is a 
contributor to health and health disparities, and identi -
fied the 4 overarching policy themes: enhancing early child development, promoting fair employment and 
decent work, providing social protection, and improv -
ing living environment.
Several pathways are possible for the association 
between economic instability and CVD.7 Economic in -
stability can lead to chronic stress, which, in turn, stim -
ulates the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal 
cortex and then results in an increased level of stress 
hormones, such as catecholamines, independent pre -
dictors for the development of CVD.7,113,114 People with 
economic instability could have more trouble getting 
medical care in a timely manner and paying for their 
prescription medications, especially if they have to pay 
out of pocket.115 – 118 It may also be attributable to the 
mediating role of conventional CVD risk factors, such 
as high blood pressure and diabetes, because they are 
unlikely to be treated efficiently and promptly among 
economically instable individuals.119 The limited dietary 
alternatives and basic necessities (food, shelter, and 
clothing), inadequate sleep quality and quantity, heavy 
drinking and excessive alcohol intake, and illegal drug 
use are also more prevalent in people with economic 
instability, such as homeless people and people with 
food insecurity, and these might contribute to the high 
occurrence of CVD.120 Economically instable people 
are also forced to eat less- nutritious and high-  energy 
items ,121 with a higher intake of sugar-  sweetened bev -
erages and processed meats, and this might result in 
CVD.122–  124 However, in this theme, we identified in -
consistent evidence for the association between job 
insecurity and CVD. Notably, the reviews were differ -
ent in scope. For instance, 2 reviews were interested 
in people working in the formal economy or people at 
work and observed no association with ischemic heart 
disease.86,87 However, the other review was interested 
in self- reported job insecurity in the general popula -
tion and observed an association with coronary heart 
disease.85 This is in contrast to the notion that job in -
security can induce stress125 and jeopardize the ability 
to meet crucial demands, including economic safety 
and social status, which, in turn, has an impact on 
CVD.125–  127 We also noted that there was no consistent 
evidence of an association between composite SES, 
education, and income with the specific CVD subtype, 
atrial fibrillation. This is somewhat unexpected and 
could be because atrial fibrillation is difficult to diag-
nose and socioeconomically privileged individuals may 
have the time and financial resources to visit a physi -
cian and obtain expensive heart rate monitoring.128
Social and Community Context
This umbrella review found evidence that social role, 
social isolation, loneliness, ethnicity, and discrimination 
were associated with a higher risk of CVD. However, 
there were also reviews in this theme that reported 

J Am Heart Assoc. 2023;12:e029765. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.123.029765 11
Teshale et al Social Determinants of Cardiovascular Diseasesan inconsistent or null association. For example, so -
cial support was not associated with CVD in most re -
views, and social capital was not associated with CVD 
subtypes.
A report from the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine identifies poor social health 
(particularly social isolation and loneliness) as a CVD 
risk factor, accounting for a one-  third increase in CVD, 
a 4 times increase in risk of death, and an increased 
risk of hospitalization and emergency department vis -
its.129 Preclinical studies also reported a link between 
a higher level of blood pressure, heart rate, and corti -
sol levels with social support and social isolation.130,131 
Poor social health also increases the risk of develop -
ing CVD through a variety of psychological, physiolog-
ical, and emotional mechanisms.19 It is hypothesized 
that poor social health, such as loneliness, is related 
to depression, anger, and hostility, as well as reduced 
buffering of external stressors.132 The negative psycho -
logical exposures can amplify harmful physiological re -
actions, like activated hypothalamic-  pituitary-  adrenal 
axis and elevated levels of inflammatory markers.7 
These inflammatory markers and the cardiometabolic 
changes in response to stressors that happened be -
cause of poor social health, particularly loneliness, 
could increase blood pressure and result in variability in 
heart rate.132,133 People with poor social or community 
engagement are also more likely to have elevated be -
havioral CVD risk factors, such as smoking, substance 
abuse, and low physical activity.19 Furthermore, poor 
social health affects people’s ability to receive medical 
support,134 and this can result in an advanced stage of 
any disease condition, such as CVD.
The ethnic and racial disparity in CVD has been 
attributed to population differences in societal factors 
(including discrimination), which impact substantially 
on people’s health.135 Notably, our umbrella review 
is limited as we were unable to make generalizations 
based on the terminology of ethnic and racial groups 
described by the review authors. For example, individ-
uals who identified as Black in terms of race may also 
identify as Hispanic in terms of ethnicity, and many 
studies did not define specific racial or ethnic group -
ings in this way.
Early Childhood Development
In this umbrella review, adverse childhood experiences, 
including cumulative adverse events, adverse events 
specific to abuse and neglect, and lower SES, were 
associated with an increased risk of later- life CVD.
This is in line with a report by Child Welfare 
Information Gateway136 explaining that the disruption of 
neurodevelopment attributable to early childhood ad -
verse experiences increases the risk for the following: 
(1) physical health consequences, such as diabetes, stroke, health attack, malnutrition, and high blood 
pressure; (2) psychological consequences, such as di -
minished cognitive skills, poor mental and emotional 
health, posttraumatic stress, and social difficulties; and 
(3) behavioral consequences, like engaging in aversive 
and self-  destructive behaviors, like smoking and sub -
stance abuse. Our finding also agrees with the afore -
mentioned health evidence network synthesis report112 
and with a guideline that urges early access to sup -
porting services for children to help them reach their 
full potential later in life and avoid serious conditions, 
like CVD.137 Unfavorable early childhood experiences 
may also hinder regular emotional and psychosocial 
development and increase susceptibility to a range 
of behavioral, mental, and physical health difficulties 
in later life, which, in turn, raises the risk of CVD. For 
instance, it has been demonstrated that exposure to 
extremely stressful events during childhood can result 
in engaging in aversive and self-  destructive behaviors, 
like substance abuse, physical inactivity, sleep disor -
der, and early-  onset obesity and type 2 diabetes.138– 141 
It can also be rationalized by the possibility that neg-
ative childhood experiences led to an increased ca -
rotid intima- media thickness, one of the most prevalent 
CVD biomarkers,142 as well as alterations in nervous, 
neuroendocrine, and immune systems that undergo 
age- dependent maturation.141,143,144 These systems are 
important for stress regulation. However, adverse ex -
periences could result in chronic stress and, in turn, re -
sult in activation of the hypothalamic-  pituitary-  adrenal 
axis and then dysregulation and excessive release of 
glucocorticoid hormones, such as cortisol.145 Through 
the above mechanisms, unfavourable childhood ex -
periences could harm several physiological systems, 
including the cardiovascular system, in later life.141
Neighborhood and Built Environment
There was evidence that poor neighborhood SES, vio -
lence (for composite CVD), and environmental attrib -
utes were associated with an increased risk of CVD. 
Notably, the evidence for environmental attributes was 
for CVD subtypes, except stroke mortality, in which 
the finding was inconsistent, highlighting the opportu -
nity for a composite CVD systematic review. However, 
there was inconsistent evidence for the role of violence 
and conflict in CVD subtypes.
Our finding of neighborhood socioeconomic dis -
advantage being associated with CVD is aligned with 
a study by Gary-  Webb et al146 that identified living in 
neighborhoods with socioeconomic disadvantage is 
associated with poorer health status (physical health, 
mental health, and global health composite scores). 
Similarly, the aforementioned health evidence network 
synthesis report revealed that living environment is 
an important factor for health and health inequality.112 

J Am Heart Assoc. 2023;12:e029765. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.123.029765 12
Teshale et al Social Determinants of Cardiovascular DiseasesLiving in a socially deprived neighborhood is associ -
ated with increased stress and poorer lifestyle fac -
tors (smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet), 
which all increase the of risk of CVD.147 This is aligned 
with our finding for environmental attributes, especially 
food environments, and CVD. It has been commonly 
claimed that the accessibility of affordable, culturally 
appropriate, healthful foods close to people’s places 
of residence and workplaces influences food choices, 
which, in turn, affects CVD risk factors and out -
comes.148 Hence, a study on food environment policy 
implementation recommends an urgent need of tack -
ling the burden of obesity and diet- related noncom -
municable diseases through prioritizing actions toward 
healthy food environments.149
Strengths and Limitations
This is the first umbrella review to assess the role of 
SDoH in CVD. We comprehensively reviewed the evi -
dence by incorporating 4 themes of SDoH, including 
health literacy in the health and health care domain. 
All CVD outcomes, including subtypes and mortality, 
were assessed. Furthermore, our findings are based 
on systematic reviews, which rank first in the hierarchy 
of evidence.
All interpretations should be used with caution, how -
ever, as this umbrella review does have some limitations. 
First, except for 2 reviews (1 medium quality68 and 1 high 
quality69), all reviews were graded as low and critically 
low quality based on the AMSTAR 2 quality assessment 
tool. Reviews with inadequate methods are difficult to 
understand, tend to overestimate the overall treatment 
effect, and may draw the wrong conclusions. Second, 
the terminology and measurement of SDoH factors 
within and between reviews varied greatly. As social de -
terminants can be context specific (relating to a time or 
place), measurement recommendations similar to bio -
logical factors, such as blood pressure, cannot neces -
sarily be created. However, research translation could 
be improved by SDoH factors being clearly defined and 
tested in sensitivity analyses. Third, we identified several 
SDoH factors; however, SDoH is abroad concept, and 
there are likely other SDoH factors that should be con -
sidered. It is also unlikely that one systematic review (eg, 
there was only one systematic review for conflict) would 
provide strong and enough evidence to saturate SDoH 
areas, as researchers bring a different lens to research 
that is reflected in eligibility criteria, outcomes, and inter -
pretation of findings. Also, the lack of or few systematic 
reviews likely demonstrate a lack of primary studies and 
the need for further research. Fourth, primary studies 
may have been included in >1 review, and it was not 
feasible to assess this. Fifth, although most reviews in 
the economic circumstance theme report the absence 
of publication bias, most reviews in other themes report that there was a publication bias or did not report any 
information about publication bias, which limits the in -
terpretation of our findings. Sixth, given the nature of the 
topic, the systematic reviews predominantly included 
observational studies with few randomized controlled 
trials, and observational studies are more prone to bias 
and confounding. For example, in our review, economic 
circumstance may influence the neighborhood that the 
person lives in. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the 
contribution of each factor, or SDoH in this case, even 
if analyses have controlled for potential confounders. 
We acknowledge that the individual studies had differ -
ences in populations and comparison groups as well, 
and these differences could help explain the somewhat 
inconsistent findings. Despite these differences, overall, 
we found evidence that SDoH are important contributors 
to CVD and CVD mortality. These differences between 
included reviews also increase the generalization of our 
findings and could be considered a strength of this um -
brella review. Last, because studies in the included sys -
tematic review are observational, there may be survival 
bias. That is, those in the most impoverished or worse 
SDoH may have died at an early age because of these 
impoverished conditions and were not considered in the 
study. In addition, there might be healthy volunteer bias; 
people with existing medical conditions are less likely 
to volunteer and participate in epidemiological studies. 
Therefore, our results may be influenced by survival bias 
and the healthy volunteer effect; the first is especially rel -
evant for the early childhood development theme.
Implications for Practice
There is an urgent need to focus on implementing 
cost-  effective policies and interventions to reduce 
premature mortality attributable to noncommunicable 
disease.1 The World Health Organization has a sustain -
able development goal (number 3, target 4) of reducing 
premature mortality attributable to noncommunicable 
diseases by a third by 2030.150 CVD is by far the most 
common noncommunicable disease151; therefore, ef -
forts to reduce CVD will likely have the greatest impact.
This umbrella review provides simple yet compre -
hensive evidence about the roles of SDoH in CVD out -
comes and demonstrates that the massive burden of 
CVD could be lessened by recognizing and addressing 
unfavorable SDoH. Our evidence suggests the impor -
tance of taking a system view of risk factors for CVD. 
The breadth of SDoH factors linked with CVD identified 
in this umbrella review along with the interconnections 
that are known to exist between these SDoH factors 
(and other CVD risk factors) imply that addressing one 
factor in isolation is unlikely to make much difference. 
There is a need for policies and interventions to take 
a holistic and integrated approach, tackling SDoH at 
macro and meso levels, and considering the knock-  on

Teshale et al Social Determinants of Cardiovascular Diseasesconsequences that changes in one factor will have in 
others. A complex adaptive systems approach with 
interconnected policies across each of the 4 theme 
areas we identified, as well as the health and health 
care theme, would greatly benefit health and well- 
being across many domains.
More immediately, this evidence can be used to 
inform the development of CVD prevention interven -
tions, as well as selection of targeted subpopulations 
to increase the impact of such interventions. The ev -
idence found could be used by policy makers and 
health care professionals to set appropriate guide -
lines and policies and to improve patient outcomes 
through nonmedical interventions, such as social pre -
scribing.152 Because SDoH are currently overlooked in 
predicting health outcomes, including CVD,153–  156 and 
because our review identified that SDoH factors have 
a role in CVD and CVD mortality, we recommend that 
future clinical CVD prediction models should include 
the SDoH.
CONCLUSIONS
This comprehensive umbrella review provides over -
whelming evidence that SDoH are important contribu -
tors to CVD and CVD mortality. We identified consistent 
evidence that economic circumstance and early child -
hood development themes play a role in CVD and CVD 
mortality. Specifically, we identified evidence that child-
hood adverse events, childhood abuse or neglect, child -
hood SES, neighborhood SES, violence, environmental 
attributes, education, income, occupation, food insecu -
rity, homelessness, composite SES, social role, social 
isolation, loneliness, ethnicity, and discrimination play 
roles in CVD and CVD mortality. However, as we only 
identified 1 or 2 systematic reviews assessing homeless -
ness or household instability, food insecurity, neighbor -
hood conflict, environmental attributes, or discrimination 
with CVD, further studies and synthesis are required. In 
addition, we identified a complete lack of evidence syn -
thesis for health literacy with CVD or CVD mortality.
Although our findings are constrained by the in -
cluded reviews’ low methodological quality, the impli -
cations of our findings are clear; we provide evidence 
that detecting and addressing SDoH will likely benefit 
CVD risk factors and outcomes. This evidence should 
be used to inform CVD prevention policies and inter -
ventions through each stage of development, including 
selection of targeted subpopulations. Given that the 
identified SDoH factors are interconnected with each 
other and other CVD risk factors, our evidence sug-
gests the importance of taking a system view with a 
holistic and integrated approach. Furthermore, incor -
porating SDoH into CVD risk prediction models could 
be helpful to set nonmedical interventions and to lower 
the social inequities in health.ARTICLE INFORMATION

Supplemental Results: Full narration of findings   
Factors relating to economic stability and CVD 
Composite SES: Findings from system atic review s witho ut meta-analysi s showed that 
lower composite SES was associated with a high er ris k of composite CVD61 and mortality 
from CVD.24 When examined by subtype of CVD, low er composite SES was associated with 
a higher risk of stroke,24 coronary artery disease,24 heart failure,74 heart disease,43 
myocardial infarction,24 and cardiomyopathy.42 Of the systematic review witho ut meta-
analysi s findings, only a study by Allan et al.75 reported an inconsistent relationship between 
lower SES and atrial fibrillation ( Figure S1). Of the three systematic review s with meta-
analysis,71-73 two of them reported that low er composite SES was associated with a higher 
risk of stroke73 (pooled haz ard ratio (HR)=1.31; 95%CI: 1.16, 1.48, I2= 48% and p = 0.02) 
and strok e mortality71 (pooled RR=1.31; 95%CI: 1.16, 1.48, I2=69.5% and p=0.001). 
Besides, the overall lower SES (combined education, occupation, income, and composite 
SES), as compared with the higher SES, was associ ated with a higher ris k of stroke 
mortality71 (pooled OR=1.39 (95% CI, 1.31, 1.48, I2 = 89.9% and p = 0.001). The other 
systematic review with meta-analysi s reported that subjective social status, adjusted for 
objective socioeconomi c status, was not significantly associ ated with coronary artery 
disease (pooled odds ratio (OR)=1.12; 95%CI: 0.52, 2.16, I2=0.0% and p=0.509).72  
Education: Two systematic review s witho ut meta-analysi s found an inconsistent 
association between education and composite CVD83 and atrial fibrillation,82 and two 
systematic review s witho ut meta-analysis61, 62 revealed that the ris k of ischemic heart 
disease was higher among low er education group ( Figu re S1 ). When we take into account 
systematic review s with meta-analysis, two of them (on e meta-analysis81 reported a 
separate effect siz e for male and femal e) indicated that having a low er educational level was 
significantly associated with composite CVD, pooled OR rang es from 1.2-1.50.80, 81 Lower 
education level was also significantly associated with a higher ris k of composite CVD 
mortality,76, 80 stroke78, 80, 81  and strok e mortality71, coronary artery disease,80, 81 and acute 
myocardial infarction79 (Figure S2 ).    
Occupation/employment: In all systemati c review s witho ut meta-analysis, except one 
that showed a non-significant association between occupation and composite CVD,83 lower 
occupation or unemployment status was significantly associ ated with high er ris ks of 
composite CVD61, 84 and CVD mortality,61, 84 angina pectoris,61 acute myocardial infarction,61 
stroke,61, 84 ischemi c heart disease,62, 84 and atrial fibrillation82 (Figure S1 ). As shown in the 
forest plot ( Figure S3), the result s of systematic review s with meta-analysi s evaluated that 

having lowest occupation level was associated with CVD and CVD mortality (effect 
estimates >1 in all studies). The findings were significant in five studies and they all revealed 
increa sed risk of composite CVD ,81 stroke mortality ,71 acute myocardial infarction ,79 and 
heart failure77 among people with the lower occupational status ( Figure S3 ).  
Income: Two systematic reviews without meta -analysis found an increased risk of 
composite CVD mortality ,61 myocardial infarction ,61 and cardiomyopathy .42 However, one 
systematic review without meta -analysis  found an inconsistent finding for an association 
between a lower level of income and the risk of atrial fibrillation82 (Figure S1 ). Looking at the 
findings from systematic reviews with meta -analysis , all revealed that lower income level 
was associated with higher risks of CVD. Of these, the majority found a significant 
association. A lower level of income was significantly associated w ith a higher risk of CVD 
mortality76, 80 and stroke mortality ,71 risk of stroke (borderline significant) ,80 coronary artery 
disease ,80 acute myocardial infarction ,79 and heart failure77 (Figure S4 ). 
Job insecurity: Two systematic reviews without meta -analysis found a non -significant high 
risk, as well as insufficient evidence of association between job insecurity and ischemic heart 
disease .66, 86 One systematic review without meta -analysis also found a non -significant 
positive association between self -reported job insecurity at baseline and incident coronary 
heart disease87 (Figure S1 ). Besides, a finding from one systematic review with meta -
analy sis (the only identified meta -analysis) revealed a modest association between 
perceived job insecurity and incident coronary heart disease (pooled  relative risk (RR)=1.19; 
95%CI: 1.00, 1.42, I2 = 24.6%, and P=0.170 ).85  
Food insecurity and homelessness/hou sehold instability:  According to findings 
from a systematic review without meta -analysis, composite CVD, CVD mortality, heart 
failure, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction were significantly higher among 
food-insecure individuals .57 This review also reported an increased risk of composite CVD 
and CVD mortality, but not significant for CVD subtypes, among individuals with housing 
insecurity57 (Figure S1 ). Additionally, a systematic review with meta -analysis88 found a 
strong significant posi tive association between homelessness and composite CVD (pooled 
OR=2.96; 95%CI: 2.80, 3.13, I2 = 99.1 % and P<0.001 ).  
Factors relating to social and community context and CVD  
Poor social support: According to a systematic review without meta -analysis by Barth et 
al.,67 low structural social support was not significantly associated with myocardial infarction 
(RR ranges from 1.01 to 1.2). However, low functional social support was associated with 
the incidence of myocardial infarction (RR range from 1.00 to 2.23). There w as a significantly 

higher risk of developing ischemic heart disease among those with lack of social support in 
both males and females .66 There was also a higher risks of coronary heart disease among 
people with lack of social support63 (Figure S1 ). Accordi ng to findings from systematic 
reviews with meta -analysis, lack of social support had no a statistically  significant 
association with composite CVD and CVD mortality .90 A study by Freak -Poli et al.68 also 
revealed a non -significant association between soci al support and composite CVD, stroke, 
and coronary heart disease. However, there was a statistically significant association 
between lack of social support and stroke66, 89 (Figure S4 ). 
Loneliness and/or social isolation: High loneliness and social isolati on were 
associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease ,91 heart disease ,60 and 
stroke .91, 60 However, a non -significant association between loneliness and mortality from 
ischemic heart disease was also reported91 (Figure S1 ). Systemat ic reviews with meta -
analysis, as stated in the forest plot ( Figure S4 ), revealed a statistically significant 
association between social isolation and loneliness and increased risk of coronary heart 
disease and stroke .25  
Social capital (social role, socia l cohesion, and social network): According to a 
systematic review without meta -analysis by Chin et al. ,92 fewer social role were linked to 
higher composite CVD and CVD mortality. However, there was no statistically significant 
association between the socia l capital index (social cohesion and social network) and 
composite CVD mortality93, 94 (Figure S1 ). One systematic review with meta -analysis 
evaluated interpersonal -level resilience resources (social networks) and found that social 
network was associated with lower odds of stroke, coronary heart disease, and CVD 
mortality (the finding was significant for CVD mortality only) .57 It also  examined 
neighbourhood -level resilience resources (perceived social cohesion) and found perceived 
social cohesion as an imp ortant factor for lower odds of stroke and coronary heart disease, 
however, the findings were not statistically significant ( Figure S4 ). 
Discrimination: Only one systematic review without meta -analysis examined the 
association between discrimination and CV D and found men and women who self -reported 
lifetime racial discrimination had a greater risk of incident composite CVD and CVD mortality 
than those reporting no lifetime racial discrimination. It was also associated with a greater 
likelihood of reporting myocardial infarction, angina, and stroke56 (Figure S1 ). 
Ethnicity and/or race: The identified systematic reviews without meta -analysis revealed 
being in a certain race or ethnic group was associated with a higher risk of CVD .42, 75, 98 As 
compared to Whit es; Asians, Chinses, African -Americans, Hispanics, and Non -Hispanic 
Blacks had a statistically significant lower risk for atrial fibrillation .75 Mortality due to ischemic 

heart disease was lower among Afro -Caribbean as compared to Caucasians .98 However, 
one systematic review without meta -analysis found an inconsistent and no evidence of race -
based disparities in CVD50 (Figure S1 ). Systematic reviews with meta -analysis also 
examined the link between ethnicity and CVD. A review by Ezzatvar et al.69 revealed t hat 
Hispanic Americans had reduced risks of composite CVD, coronary artery disease, stroke, 
and heart failure than White people. Two systematic reviews with meta -analysis also 
revealed a lower risk of coronary heart disease69 and Atrial fibrillation51 amon g Blacks as 
compared to Whites. A lower risk of composite CVD mortality among Hispanics compared to 
non-Hispanics was also reported .55 Besides, Chinese had a lower risk of coronary artery 
disease as compared to whites and south Asians, respectively .97 Furthermore, as compared 
to Caucasians and White Europeans, Asians had a lower risk of peripheral arterial 
diseases47, 96 (Figure S6 ).     
Factors relating to early childhood development and CVD  
Adverse childhood events: Adversity during childhood was associated with a higher risk 
of composite CVD, coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure, with additional adversity 
increased the risk by 30% -70%.102 Violence during childhood was associated with a higher 
risk of later life CVD (ischemic heart dis ease, myocardial infarction, and stroke) .106 One 
systematic review without meta -analysis also found a dose -response relationship between 
childhood adverse exposures and ischemic heart disease48 (Figure S1 ). Considering 
findings from systematic reviews with  meta -analysis, being exposed to adverse events 
during childhood was significantly associated with adulthood composite CVD ,104 myocardial 
infarction ,105 and ischemic heart disease .52 Besides, being exposed to childhood abuse and 
neglect was associated with  a higher risk of composite CVD53, 103 and ischemic heart 
disease ,103 respectively. Furthermore, there was a borderline significant association between 
childhood neglect and a higher risk of later life stroke103 (Figure S7 ).  
Childhood SES: From the majority of systematic reviews without meta -analysis  
findings, l ower childhood SES were associated with a higher risk of composite CVD ,65, 102 
coronary heart disease ,102 and stroke ,101, 102 but not associated with heart failure .101 Besides, 
CVD mortality ,64, 102 coronary heart disease mortality ,64 and mortality from stroke64 were  
higher among adults with poor childhood SES. However, two systematic reviews without 
meta -analysis reported an inconsistent and null, respectively, association between childhood 
SES and CVD (coronary heart disease and heart disease)99, 100 (Figure S1 ). When we 
consider the finding from systematic review with meta -analysis, lower childhood SES was 
associated with higher risks of stroke78 (pooled HR= 1.31; 95%CI: 1.03, 1.68 and pooled  
OR= 1.28; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.46) ( Figure S7 ).   

Factors relating to neighbourhood and built environment and CVD  
Violence during adulthood: Findings from the majority of systematic reviews without 
meta -analysis revealed that intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk 
of CVD .54, 108, 109 Besides, sexual abuse in the military was significantly associated with being 
treated for a myocardial infarction but not being treated for a stroke .59 However, one 
systematic review without meta -analys is found a mixed finding (null and increased risk) 
between adulthood violence and myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, myocardial 
infarction, and stroke106 (Figure S1) . A systematic review with meta -analysis also reported a 
mixed finding with dif ferent measures of association .107 It revealed that the hazard of having 
composite CVD was 1.32 times higher among individuals with a history of sexual violence as 
compared to their counterparts. However, using OR as a measure of association, a history of 
sexual violence was not significantly associated with CVD ( Figure S8 ). 
Conflict: A systematic review without meta -analysis  found that there was a significant 
association between armed conflict and an increased risk of mortality from chronic ischemic 
heart disease and heart disease70 but not mortality due to stroke70. The same study also 
revealed no significant association between armed conflict and myocardial infarction, 
ischemic heart disease, and angina pectoris. In addition, conflict had an inconsistent 
association with heart disease and stroke70 (Figure S1) . 
Environmental attributes: A systematic review without meta -analysis revealed that there 
was a significant positive association between environmental attributes (proximity to a major 
road, reduced acc ess to food stores, no recreational areas, and increased access to fast -
food restaurants, far from a healthcare facility, and high traffic density) and coronary heart 
disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and angina .110 Besides, fast food 
restaurant availability was found as a significant factor for stroke .49 However, food 
environments, assessed among adults with low SES, such as access to grocery stores, and 
fast food restaurants were not associated with coronary heart disease49 (Figure S1 ).  
Neighbourhood SES : One systematic review without meta -analysis studied the 
association between neighbourhood SES and the incidence of stroke .26 This study found 
that a h igher neighbourhood disadvantage  was associated with a higher r isk of stroke, 
however, the findings were not statistically significant ( Figure S1) . Additionally, three 
systematic reviews with meta -analysis  report that neighbourhood socioeconomic 
disadvantage was associated with a higher risk of CVD mortality, incidenc e of heart failure, 
coronary heart disease, and stroke .77, 81, 111 Of these, one considers male and female 
participants separately and found a similar significant finding81 (Figure S8 ).

Table S 5. Summary of the included variables under s ocial determinants of health: Evidence from the included reviews  
Construct Measurement and/or description 
Socioeconomic status 
(composite)  A composite variable using education -based measures such as literacy or years of schooling, aggregate 
measures (combination of education, income, housing, social castes or standardized scales), and income -based 
measures .24, 61 Besides the above -mentioned measures, one study includes area -level socioeconomic measures 

(Carstairs and Index of Multiple Deprivation) .71 A study by Salgado -Barreira et al.43 also reports different 
measures for socioeconomic status.  
Subjective social status: according to  the author of the systematic review ,72 the included primary studies used a 
10-rung ladder, a nine -rung ladder, the societal ladder, and the community ladder to measure subjective social
status.  People with a higher subjective social status were those who have the most money, the most education, 
and the most respected jobs. Those under lower subjective social status have the least money, the least 
education, and the least respected jobs or no job .  
Education  The majority of the reviews used years of school ing to measure education and the cut point to say high and low 
levels of education was different (the cut point could  be below and above college, high school, grade eight, 
etc).62, 80, 81, 83
In one study, it was categorised into three groups; low (years ≤9), medium (10 –12), and high (>12 years of 
education) .80 However, for this umbrella review, we used the low vs high category to be consistent with other 
included reviews.    
Occupation In the majority of the studies, occupation was measured as manual vs  non-manual. Others used employed vs 
unemployed, white collar vs blue -collar, manufacturing labo rer vs officials, and others.61, 76, 77, 83 Occupation was 
measured differently between reviews and between primary studies in the included reviews. Manual labo urers, 
unemployed people, and/or blue -collar workers were mainly considered as a low occupational group (low -skilled 
workers) .61, 62, 82, 84
Income Most reviews referred to income as high and low without mentioning the cut point utilised to determine hi gh and 
low.61 One review used salary income with cut points; low (20,000), medium (20,001 to 40,000), and high for 
income (>40,000 USA dollar) per year .80 This study does analyses separately for the three cut points. However, 
to make in line with the inclu ded reviews, we used the cut point that compared high - and low -income levels.  

Homelessness/Housing 
instability and Food 
insecurity  One review reported housing instability and food insecurity . This review reported different databases and 
questionnaires  used to measure housing instability and food insecurity ,57 too many databases and 
questionnaires to state here . The other review did say nothing about how homelessness was measured . 88 
Job insecurity  Like other social determinants of health variables, t he assessment of job insecurity across systematic reviews 
and within systematic reviews was different. In majorly it was measured: (1) using a global single -item question 
or a multidimensional dichotomised scale question; (2) using a s ubscale of the job conte nt questionnaire (job 
insecurity scale section); (3) Other questionnaires .85, 86  
Loneliness, social isolation, 
and/or Lack of social 
support  Measured using: (1) unvalidated 26 - item interview (tertiles); (2) Short version of ISSI (quartiles); (3) using a  
single question(feelings of loneliness in the past 12 months or do you ever feel lonely); (4) using the revised 
UCLA Loneliness Scale; (5) using social support questionnaire (SSQ6); (6) Berkman –Syme SNI; (7) Duke 
Social Support Scale; (8) the SSI, and (9)  using De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale .25, 60, 67, 68  
In one review , social isolation was divided into structural (participants answered whether they lived alone or not) 
and functional (feeling of being socially isolated) .67  
Social capital and social role Social capital was measured using indicators; (1) social cohesion: trust, civic/social participation, reciprocity, 
satisfaction with the environment, voting, helpfulness, collective efficacy, volunteering, crime, and control and (2) 
Social networks su ch as social support .58, 94  
The social role was measured using either: (1) an unvalidated 26 - item interview (tertiles); (2) a short version of 
ISSI (quartiles); (3) Berkman -Syme SNI (4 levels); (4) an unvalidated measure of all contacts and close 
contact s; (4) Berkman -Syme SNI (2 categories); (5) Lubben Social Network Scale (tertiles); (6) Lubben Social 
Network Scale (4 levels); (7) Berkman -Syme SNI (4 levels for all roles; 3 levels for close roles); and (8) 
Unvalidated 8 -item index (continuous) .92  
Discrimination  History of discrimination determined via questionnaire/interview, and laboratory stigma exposure . 56 

Ethnicity  It was mostly based on self -reported, extracted from primary care records, surname analysis, and observation 
by the administrative st aff.69, 97  
Childhood socioeconomic 
circumstances/status  Childhood socioeconomic status was based on a variety of measures including parental education, parental 
occupation, home ownership of parents, socioeconomic status of the neighbourhood that a child  was exposed 
to, number of rooms in the childhood home and access to household assets, and family structure characteristics .
64, 65, 101  
It was measured during childhood or through recall during adulthood.  
Adverse childhood events Adverse childhood events (ACEs) are includes  childhood abuse (it may be sexual, emotional, psychological, or 
verbal abuse), exposure to domestic violence, parental separation or divorce, household criminality, neglect, 
family financial problems, family con flict or discord, bullying, death of a parent or close relative or friend, and 
separation from family (for instance; out -of-home care) .52, 104, 105  
Measured using different tools such as adverse childhood experiences questionnaire by Felitti et al.  (1998) , 
adverse childhood experiences developed by Kaiser Permanent and the Centres for Disease, the Childhood 
Trauma questionnaire, and the Early Trauma Inventory – Self Report, self -report, conflict tactics scale, gathered 
adverse childhood events  data from of ficial child services and court records , and others . 48, 52  
Violence  It can be sexual abuse or assault, sexual harassment, sexual intimate partner violence or dating violence, or 
military sexual trauma.  
Measurement tools: the sexual experiences survey an d the sexual coercion section of the RCTS, a subset of 
questions from the revised Conflict Tactics Scales, using criminal records, questions from the Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), and a single question “Has your spouse/significant oth er ever forced you 
to have sexual activities?”), military sexual trauma (MST) screening questionnaire, using unvalidated single 
question  (‘Did you ever have an experience where someone used force or the threat of force to have sexual 
relations with you ag ainst your will while you were in the military?’ .59, 106, 108  

Violence can be happened during childhood; considered in the early childhood development domain or during 
adulthood; considered in the neighboorhood and built environment domain.   
Conflict Include the Croatian War of Independence (1991 –1995), Bosnian War (1992 –1995), Colombian conflict (1975 –
2015), Siege of Leningrad (1941 –1944), Lebanese Civil War (1975 –1991), Georgian -Ossetian Conflict (1989 –
present), US -led invasion of Iraq (2003 –2011), S udan Civil War (1983 –2015), Unspecific conflicts in Uganda, 
and Other conflicts .70  
Neighborhood 
socioeconomic deprivation 
(area level deprivation)  Measured using different tools such as Carstairs and Morris index, Area -level socioeconomic status composit e 
score, Neighbourhood socioeconomic status composite index, census tracts and block groups, small area 
market statistics, Chocho -Aza units, and postal or zip codes .26, 77, 81, 111  
Variables related to buil t 
environment  Geographic information system (GIS ) and subjective assessment using Neighborhood Environment Walkability 
Scale (NEWS) were used to assess the build environment .110  
The common environmental attributes identified were  proximity to a major road, access to food stores, 
recreational areas, acc ess to fast -food restaurants, distance from healthcare facility, and traffic density.  
Besides, one review was on food environments measured based on relation to participants’ residential location, 
youths’ school location or both; objectively or based on pa rticipants’ perceptions of their food environment. 
Access is in terms of count or distance relative to participants’ residence or school, while availability refers to the 
in-store availability of food products .49
