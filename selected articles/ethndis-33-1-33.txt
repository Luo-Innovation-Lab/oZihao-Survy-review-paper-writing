Introduction/Purpose: Predictive models in-
corporating relevant clinical and social featurescan provide meaningful insights into complexinterrelated mechanisms of cardiovascular dis-ease (CVD) risk and progression and the influ-ence of environmental exposures on adverseoutcomes. The purpose of this targeted review(2018 –2019) was to examine the extent to which
present-day advanced analytics, artificial intelli-
gence, and machine learning models includerelevant variables to address potential biases thatinform care, treatment, resource allocation, andmanagement of patients with CVD.
Methods: PubMed literature was searched
using the prespecified inclusion and exclusioncriteria to identify and critically evaluate primarystudies published in English that reported on
predictive models for CVD, associated risks,
progression, and outcomes in the general adultpopulation in North America. Studies were thenassessed for inclusion of relevant social variablesin the model construction. Two independentreviewers screened articles for eligibility. Primaryand secondary independent reviewers extractedinformation from each full-text article foranalysis. Disagreements were resolved with athird reviewer and iterative screening rounds toestablish consensus. Cohen ’s kappa was used to
determine interrater reliability.
Results: The review yielded 533 unique records
where 35 met the inclusion criteria. Studies usedadvanced statistical and machine learningmethods to predict CVD risk (10, 29%), mortality(19, 54%), survival (7, 20%), complication (10,29%), disease progression (6, 17%), functionaloutcomes (4, 11%), and disposition (2, 6%).Most studies incorporated age (34, 97%), sex(34, 97%), comorbid conditions (32, 91%), andbehavioral risk factor (28, 80%) variables. Raceor ethnicity (23, 66%) and social variables, such
as education (3, 9%) were less frequently
observed.Conclusions: Predictive models should adjust
for race and social predictor variables, whererelevant, to improve model accuracy and to
inform more equitable interventions and deci-
sion making. Ethn Dis. 2023;33(1):33 –43;

INTRODUCTION
Advanced analytics and arti ﬁcial
intelligence (AI) are powerful lead-
ing-edge methodologies for uncover-
ing trends, hidden patterns, and
insights to augment informed deci-
sions in health care. They can be
useful in enhancing our understandingof disease risk, progression, outcomes,
and their correlation with healthdeterminants. Over the past 2 decades,
AI and machine learning (ML) tech-niques have been applied to inform abroad range of health care decisions
and management processes across
different clinical and public healthdomains. Some of these applicationsinclude promoting precision healthand patient-centered care, optimizing
clinical operational performance, en-
hancing treatment guidelines, andpredicting disease risk and prognosis.These methodologies require data
sources with considerable volume,
variety, completeness, and timelinessto provide the accuracy and applica-bility needed for unbiased analyses.
The goal of this article is to examine
the extent to which present-day ad-vanced analytics, AI, and ML meth-odologies are addressing potential
biases in the analytic and algorithmic
models that inform care and manage-ment of patients with cardiovasculard i s e a s e( C V D ) .P r e d i c t i v em o d e l s

social factors can provide meaningfulinsights into the complex interrelatedmechanisms of CVD progression

environmental exposures on adverse
outcomes. In addition to augmentingclinical decision and care manage-ment, these models can also generateOriginal Report: Population

predictions about future CVD-related
morbidity and mortality and inform
tailored behavioral and lifestyle inter-ventions to prevent adverse events.
Cardiovascular disease remains the
leading cause of mortality in the
United States and the world despite
many advances in understanding dis-
ease development, risk, and treatment.It is well known that comorbidities,
such as mental health status, type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity,
and being overweight or physically
inactive, can adversely affect risk and
outcomes.
3Research provides evidence
t h a tf a c t o r ss u c ha sa g e ,r a c eo rethnicity, income, sex, food security,
and even community location are also
associated with disease development
and outcome. For example, the third
National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES III) has
provided longitudinal insights intomany factors that affect the risk and
development of CVD. One study
determined that the likelihood of
developing subclinical myocardial in-
jury was less likely for MexicanAmericans (odds ratio [OR], 0.74;
95% con ﬁdence interval [CI], 0.62-
0.88) compared with Whites or Blacks
and that subclinical myocardial injury
increased the risk of cardiovascular
mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.74;
95% CI, 1.13-2.67; P ,.05).
4Other
factors, such as income, have also been
associated with CVD risk. In a 10-year
study of NHANES data and predicted
absolute cardiovascular risk, the per-
centage of adults at risk for CVD by20% or more declined with time but
not for those with incomes at or below
the federal poverty level.
5
In addition to the effect on out-
comes for individuals with coexisting
chronic conditions and social disad-vantage, numerous noted disparities
exist in the published literature on the
management and treatment of
CVD.
6,7In a study of sex disparities
in adults enrolled in commercial
health plans, women with T2DMwere less likely than men with
T2DM to have their low-density-
lipoprotein cholesterol controlled at,100 mg/dL. Race or ethnicity ineq-
uities continue to exist despite a long-
standing awareness of these issues. A
study of race or ethnicity disparities in
relation to CVD and risk for individ-
uals living in New York City found
that non-Latino Black women were athigher risk of being overweight or
obese, having hypertension, and hav-
ing T2DM than non-Latino White
men or women.
8
Despite the growing body of knowl-
edge relating social determinants ofhealth (SDoH) to CVD risk and
disease progression, limited evidence
is available on the extent to which
relevant factors are currently being
incorporated into clinical predictive
models to improve performance accu-
racy. Increasing evidence suggests thatclinical risk and predictive models can
beﬂawed due to inherent biases in the
data sources, coding of the predictors,
sample size, and/or study design as
well as implicit biases in selectedoutcomes or in validating or applying
a variety of advanced analytical and AI
methodologies.
9–12Data sources may
not be fully representative of a popu-
lation of interest, resulting in model
underperformance or unreliable pre-
dictions that may perpetuate inequi-ties.
13In a published state-of-the-art
review of precision health analytics and
implementation research from the
Journal of the American College of
Cardiology , authors called for more
actionable models that could translate
across communities and subpopula-
tions, including adjustment for rele-
vant social risk factors.14
An abundance of predictive models
have been published in the past 2decades around cardiovascular disease,
some of which have been incorporated
into clinical practice guidelines.
15A
number of systematic reviews on
cardiovascular disease risk modeling
have also been published, testingvalidity of these models for incorpora-
tion into evidence-based practice andin various US population cohorts.
16
This targeted review, using system-
atic methods, collected recently pub-lished PubMed literature (2018 –2019)
and sought to identify the extent to
which race, ethnicity, and other SDoH
factors were being used to developclinical predictive models about CVDin North America. As knowledge ofthe effect of bias in data and prediction
models advances, we aim to highlight
potential challenges and propose toenrich data sets for modeling withmore representative predictors.
METHODS
A targeted review was conducted of
the PubMed literature to search, iden-tify, and critically evaluate primarystudies published in English that re-
ported on or described predictive mod-
els for cardiovascular disease, associatedrisks, and outcomes in the general adultpopulation in North America. Addi-tional scope included limiting the
review to a 2-year time frame from
January 1, 2018, to December 31,2019, and to assess the extent to whichthe models presented in the literatureincorporated sociodemographic infor-
mation, social determinants of health,
and relevant predictors of CVD.
A single reviewer conducted the
search and retrieved the relevant
articles using the prespeci ﬁed inclusion
and exclusion criteria given in Table 1.Excluded articles were those thatfocused on pediatric populations since
our focus was on adults and on stroke
and stroke management because brainand vascular imaging information werekey factors for stroke management andformed the basis of clinical decision
making. We excluded studies that
focused on CVD imaging, as our focuswas on cardiovascular risk. Predictivemodels for heart transplants wereexcluded, as those focused on popula-Factors for Reducing Disparities in Predictive CVD Risk Models –Snowdon et al

tions with congenital disease. Articles
that reported only on a re ﬁnement or
valuation of the accuracy of a predic-tion model or algorithm were alsoexcluded, as were editorials, perspec-tives, commentaries, single abstractswithout full papers for reference, andstudies conducted outside of theUnited States and Canada.
Two independent reviewers were
assigned to each article to screen foreligibility based on the title, abstract,and setting of the study. After inclu-sion consensus was reached about thearticle, primary and secondary inde-pendent reviewers were assigned toeach full-text article to extract infor-mation for analysis. The primaryreviewer independently reviewed thefull paper and categorized the type ofmethodology, AI or ML approach,CVD outcomes, and range of predic-tors included in the model. Thesecondary reviewer cross-checked andvalidated the categorization. Disagree-ments were resolved with a thirdreviewer and iterative screening roundsto establish consensus. For consistencyin data extraction and coding thepredictors, a standardized Excel dataextraction form was used. Quantitativesynthesis was conducted of the predic-tors or factors used, AI or ML andadvanced analytics approaches used,and CVD outcomes used for theclinical prediction models. Cohen ’skappa was used to determine interrater
reliability.
The analysis focused on published
articles of models that described CVDcare in the areas of risk strati ﬁcation,
prediction of disease outcomes, andCVD treatment and were also consid-ered to be of clinical signi ﬁcance.
Articles that used univariate or multi-
variable regression analysis, ML, and
natural language processing approachesfor estimating the risk of CVD, risk ofcomplications, risk of mortality, sur-vival outcome, disease progression, andfunctional outcome were included. Themodels were examined to identifywhich social determinant predictorvariables were incorporated according
to the categories of sex, race or
ethnicity, education level, employmentstatus, disability, comorbid conditions,activity limitations, region or environ-mental exposures, rurality vs urban-icity, behavioral risk factors such assmoking, and type of insurance. Anassessment was made to determinewhether the model considered 1 ormore of the social determinant variables
as well as the effect of the features on
CVD risk, progression, or outcomes.
RESULTS
The rapid review literature search
strategy identi ﬁed 533 potentially
relevant articles after duplicate re-moval. Article titles and abstracts
reviewed for eligibility excluded 375
papers based on the exclusion criteria
(Table 1). Further screening of 158potentially relevant, eligible articles
eliminated an additional 116 full-text
papers (ie, the study focused ondifferent outcomes than CVD, suchas stroke, or the predictive factor was
related to heart transplant and man-
agement). After further screening, 42papers were identi ﬁed for full-text
screening. In total, 35 articles met
criteria for inclusion
17–51(Figure 1).
Interrater reliability of eligibilitydetermination had an overall weight-ed kappa of 91% for full-text screen-
ing.
Details of results are available in
supplemental tables from the corre-
sponding author (Supplementary Ta-bles 1 –3). All studies were conducted
in North America, primarily in the

Other healthdisparity populations included werepersons with disabilities. Overall, asigniﬁcant proportion of the studiesdid not consider all the relevant
patient- and community-level SDoH
features that may in ﬂuence CVD
outcomes, nor did they incorporatediversity in model training data to
ensure an appropriate representation
of groups from health disparity or
medically underserved populations. Ta-
ble 2 organizes demographics andSDoH around clusters (age, sex, race
or ethnicity, preexisting conditions,
behavioral trends, exercise, and diet)
and what insights they provide for
CVD risks and outcomes.
DISCUSSION
Our targeted review of the current
literature shows that there are limited
published studies leveraging advancedanalytics and ML models for analyzing
and predicting CVD risk and out-
comes. Of the published studies, race
and relevant SDoH factors known to
inﬂuence CVD risk, progression, and
outcomes are often missing in the
analyses or model construction. While
most (97%) of the reviewed papers
included sex as a biologic variable,Figure 2. Frequency of advanced analytic and AI methodologies reported

only 66% of them included race or
ethnicity variables, and 69% consid-
ered census region variables.
Potential biases of the use of race or
ethnicity in AI and ML methodologies
may occur for several reasons: (1) data
that are used to train the models maybe discriminatory or unrepresentative
for people of color, women, or othermarginalized groups, and (2) bias may
be introduced, either intentionally or
unintentionally, into the outcomesthat the AI and ML models are
predicting because models are builtand used by humans. The potential
harm of AI and ML methodologies
that do not incorporate race or
ethnicity is further compounded bythe health information technology(IT) industry ’s lack of representationFigure 3. Risk and outcome predictions

of people who understand and can
address these challenges.
Very few studies incorporated data on
relevant social attributes, such as edu-cation level, unemployment, or healthinsurance status. Most studies used
downstream measures (eg, health-relat-
ed behaviors and receipt of recommend-ed medical care) and lacked inclusion ofupstream SDoH measures (eg, socialdisadvantage and racism). The notable
lack of related SDoH variables in
predictive models for CVD risk andoutcomes is of particular concern.While it is well documented that a
strong relationship exists between so-
cioeconomic contexts and the health ofindividuals and populations, the use ofSDoH variables in predictive models isimportant for examining possible causal
pathways to inform care management
for CVD. Limitations in the use ofSDoH variables in predictive modelsmay include the use of some self-reported variables, which may introduce
a risk of recall bias, and the lack of
availability of some factors in a data set.
Even though disparities in CVD
prevention and treatment have been
evident in the literature for de-
cades,
66,67existing predictive analytics
or AI models often do not fully
consider and explain the exacerbated
risk facing disadvantaged populations.For example, the American College ofCardiology/American Heart Associa-
tion Pooled Cohort Equations Risk
Model systematically underpredictsatherosclerotic CVD among disadvan-
taged populations; however, adjusting
the neighborhood disadvantage indexcan dramatically improve the riskprediction.
68
Additional observations regarding
this limited review include the follow-ing:
1. While there is increased awareness of
the associations between patient-levelsocial, behavioral, and economic factors
as well as community-level factors of
food access or neighborhood social
capital on CVD risk, progression, andadverse outcomes, studies that predict
risk, disease progression, morbidity
survival, functionality, and survivaloutcomes do not include these featuresin their analyses.
2. Many studies relied heavily on the
clinical data sets, research databases, orreal-world evidence data sources (eg,
blood pressure, triglyceride levels, ar-
tery wall thickness, comorbid condi-tions, adherence to medications, and
symptomatology) that are obtained
from either electronic health records(EHRs) or administrative claims to
make these predictions.
3. Most studies that incorporate advanced
analytics or ML also incorporate static
social variables in addition to the
clinical features, which may changeover time and thus affect the prediction
or risk.
4. An enhanced data architecture and
expanded infrastructure, as well as a
data analytics platform, are needed toTable 2. Key references exploring demographics and SDoH factors and their relationships for CVD risks and outcomes

5. Ethical frameworks for inclusion of
SDoH variables into risk and predictive
algorithms, as well as standardization ofSDoH measures for feature engineer-
ing, may be needed to advance the
accuracy of risk and predictive models
for cardiovascular disease.

addition of a panel of SDoH measuresto traditional risk adjustment modelsimproved the prediction accuracy of
clinical risk models for CVD hospital-
ization, annual cost, and death amongracial and ethnic minorities. Modelswithout SDoH signi ﬁcantly under-
predicted all-cause and cardiovascular
hospitalizations by 20% and 70%,respectively. Although further researchis needed to explore whether SDoHplays the most crucial role in risk
prediction for CVD or other chronic
disease hospitalization and mortality,this study provided meaningful evi-dence of the importance of incorpo-
rating SDoH in predictive analytics,
including AI. As more health systemsuse EHRs to manage chronic illnesswith the goal of improving health
outcomes, AI and ML techniques have
advanced simultaneously to providesmart solutions for clinical decisionsupport and provider or patient edu-
cation. Incorporating SDoH parame-
ters in AI or ML algorithms is vital forestablishing an equitable and unbiasedsystem.
It is critical for advanced analytical
technologies and AI models to incor-
porate equity, diversity, and inclusionthroughout the data capture, modeldesign, development, and implemen-
tation phases. To do this, ﬁrst we need
to incorporate standardized collectionand input of race or ethnicity, socio-economic status, and other SDoHmeasures in all systems that collect
health data.
70Because most AI andML algorithms and models are built
on existing health information infra-
structure, including extensive use ofEHR data, we need to identify
deﬁciencies in the existing health IT
system ’s ability to support health
equity measures and adopt stakehold-
er-centered approaches to address
these de ﬁciencies.
71Additionally, it
was suggested that SDoH measures(eg, substance abuse and housing
status) captured in patient records
(both structured and unstructured,
such as clinical notes) may exhibit
changes over time due to data qualityand other issues.
72Multiple instances
of SDoH documentation may be
needed. Also, natural language pro-
cessing tools could be used to extract
SDoH information from clinical notes
to further verify the health equity
status and changes over time.
In addition to systemic complexity,
providers often ﬁnd it is dif ﬁcult to
obtain SDoH information from pa-
tients and retrieve SDoH information
from EHRs, and some may be un-
aware of its consequences on lowquality of care among populations
affected by health disparities.
73Med-
ical education and awareness efforts to
encourage incorporating SDoH into
predictive analytics for disease man-
agement are hence warranted.
The advancement of data science
and high-performance computing have
initiated the AI era. Using advanced
analytics and AI approaches for pre-
dictive modeling provides new oppor-
tunities to better understand CVD
prevention and treatment at the indi-vidual and population levels. However,
it also raises the health equity concern
given the many lessons learned, in-
cluding most recently that racial or
ethnic minorities and other vulnerablepopulations suffered disproportional
burden due to barriers in access and
high risks of chronic comorbidities
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Advanced analytics and AI approaches
that do not incorporate or considerdemographic and SDoH factors will
likely lead to biased results, which may
in turn lead to undesirable healthoutcomes. Thus, developing novel
methods and intervention research
using AI to address minority health
and health disparities is an important
component for enhancing the use of
EHR to improve health care quality.
As an example, the US NationalCOVID Cohort Collaborative, with
its additional linkages to many social,
environmental, and behavioral public
data sets, has provided a valuable
open-access resource for the scienti ﬁc
community. Furthermore, the Nation-
al Institutes of Health (NIH) estab-
lished the AIM-AHEAD program to
increase the participation and repre-sentation of underrepresented re-
searchers and communities in AI or
ML model development.
74SDoH
should be considered a major in ﬂu-
encer in biomedical research.75,76Both
precision medicine and precision pub-
lic health need to incorporate demo-graphic and SDoH information in
clinical or policy decision making in
order to identify the right intervention
for the right person in the right
community at the right dose and the
right time.
77For the ﬁrst time in
history, the NIH has recommended itsCOVID-19 funding opportunity an-
nouncements to incorporate the
PhenX Social Determinants of Health
Assessments Collection.
76,78The col-
lection includes not only individual
SDoH (eg, access to health service,
discrimination, English pro ﬁciency,
job insecurity, and wealth) but also
structural SDoH (eg, air quality,
environmental justice, residential seg-
regation, and social vulnerability).
Our review is limited to CVD
literature and does not capture all theevidence from other chronic diseases
and conditions using advanced analyt-
ics and AI approaches. Moreover,
many international countries have
pioneered using AI for CVD preven-
tion and treatment. Their experienceFactors for Reducing Disparities in Predictive CVD Risk Models –Snowdon et al
40 Ethnicity & Disease, Volume 33, Number 1, Winter 2023

and lessons learned could be useful for
US and Canadian populations.
CONCLUSIONS
Health equity is the foundation for a
strong and resilient society. However,currently, advanced analytics and AIapproaches do not consistently factorin SDoH and health disparities inmost cases. If advanced analyticaltechnologies and AI models couldeffectively capture and incorporatethese factors, resulting insights mayi m p r o v eh o wh e a l t he q u i t yi sa d -dressed in cardiovascular health. Moreinnovative means by which to extractand standardize SDoH informationfrom EHRs and other data sourcesare needed.
