predict risk using only publicly available and purchasable SDH
data. A total of 138,115 patients were analyzed from a
deidentified database representing 3 health systems in the
United States.
Methods: A hold-out methodology was used to ensure that
the model’s performance could be tested on a completely
independent set of subjects. A proprietary decision tree
methodology was used to make the predictions. Only the
socioeconomic features—age group, gender, and
race&mdash;were used in the prediction of a patient’s risk of
admission.
Results: The decision tree—based machine learning approach
analyzed in this study was able to predict inpatient and
emergency department utilization with a high degree of
discrimination using only purchasable and publicly available
data on SDH.
Conclusions: This study indicates that it is possible to risk-
stratify patients’ risk of utilization without interacting with the
patient or collecting information beyond the patient’s age,
gender, race, and address. The implications of this application
are wide and have the potential to positively affect health
systems by facilitating targeted patient outreach with specific,
individualized interventions to tackle detrimental SDH at not
only the individual level but also the neighborhood level.

This investigation demonstrates that it is possible to predict
individual hospital and emergency department utilization using
publicly available data on socioeconomic determinants of care
and purchased behavioral data, without requiring clinical risk
factors.
It is possible to risk-stratify patients’ risk of utilization
without interacting with the patient or collecting
information beyond the patient’s age, gender, race, and
address.
The implications of this application are wide and have the
potential to positively affect health systems by facilitating
targeted patient outreach with specific, individualized
interventions to tackle detrimental social determinants of
health at not only the individual level but also the
neighborhood level.
As defined by the World Health Organization and recognized
by HHS, social determinants of health (SDH) are the conditions
in which people live, work, play, and age. SDH affect a wide
range of health-related outcomes, such as chronic conditions,
preventable hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality.
Decades of study results have found that sociodemographic
status, racial and ethnic disparities, and individual behaviors
directly correlate with an increase in the prevalence and
incidence of chronic diseases. In the United States, chronic
diseases have contributed significantly to the rise in healthcare
costs, with approximately 90% of annual healthcare
expenditures—$3.3 trillion&mdash;attributed to caring for
patients with chronic and mental health conditions. Almost
half of all Americans suffer from at least 1 chronic disease (eg,
cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, diabetes), and two-thirds of deaths are caused by 1
or more of these chronic diseases. In addition, nationwide
trends show a projected overall increase in chronic1,2

conditions. Thus, it is imperative to address SDH not only
at the individual level but at the population level as well.
Associations between economic inequality and health
disparities exist in the United States; for example, residents of
impoverished communities are at a higher risk of mental health
issues, chronic diseases, increased mortality, and lower life
expectancy. Inequalities include lack of access to healthy
food, with 17.4 million households considered food insecure;
decreased receipt of preventive medical care, with 1 in 4
individuals without a primary care provider; 3.6 million
people failing to obtain medical care due to transportation
barriers; and 65.9% of food assistance program clients
reporting the necessity to choose between food and medical
care. The need for providers and communities to address
SDH is apparent; however, healthcare providers have limited
ability and limited access to do so within their existing
workflow. Entering SDH data in electronic health records
(EHRs) is predominantly a manual documentation process
completed by providers with a limited range of determinants
and relies on patients’ self-report accuracy. From a
healthcare management approach, there is no evidence-based
screening recommendation for SDH; however, several policy
statements support screening patients for disparities.
According to a recent Kaiser Permanente survey of 1006 US
adults 18 years or older demographically matched to represent
the US population per Census data, 97% of respondents
indicated that their healthcare provider should ask about social
needs during medical visits and 80% expressed a desire for
their healthcare provider to share information about resources
to address their individual needs.

established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(ACA), are aimed toward reducing health inequalities. Such
changes direct attention to the health-related social needs of
Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and how addressing
those needs can drive improvements in population health. In
addition, expansions made to CMS’ Medicare Advantage
program include a greater level of coverage for SDH. Coverage
plans now include services like telemonitoring, benefits for
over-the-counter medications, and rides to medical
appointments for patients without transportation. This
expansion requires more data sources to track new kinds of
information that are not readily available within the EHR.
Current analyses, predictive models, and prevention initiatives
focus on addressing SDH at the population level or the zip
code level.  The shortcoming of this approach is a gap in
addressing the individual patient’s needs, such as defining
clinical action steps that are relevant to the patient as opposed
to an overall population approach. Advancements in cognitive
science allow for the analysis of individual contributions of SDH
at the patient level, informing appropriate interventions that
can reduce the risk of negative health outcomes such as
preventable readmissions and/or hospitalizations.
Additionally, increasing access to SDH based on geography (ie,
Census Data Application Programming Interface) and the
ability to purchase individual behavioral indexes may decrease
the need to collect large sets of data from individual patients.
The aim of this study is to demonstrate the influences of
socioeconomic determinants of health with regard to
utilization at the individual level. Given what is known about
the contribution of socioeconomic determinants of health,
machine learning should be able to predict utilization
independent of the patient’s clinical condition while defining16,21

which determinants confer the greatest risk. The study will
investigate the ability to predict risk with publicly available and
purchasable SDH data.
METHODS
Patient Sample
We selected 138,115 patients from a deidentified database
representing 3 health systems in the United States. The patient
sample was selected to develop the most generalizable model.
Both adult and pediatric patients were included, health systems
were chosen from 3 diverse geographical areas, and all patients
with at least 1 ambulatory, emergency department (ED), or
inpatient visit during the month of November 2018 were
included. The health systems were in urban Ohio, urban
Georgia, and rural Alabama.
Data Source
The sole data source for this study was a deidentified database
that included billing data and socioeconomic determinants of
care. Billing data were collected directly from the health
systems’ EHRs. Socioeconomic elements had previously been
collected from publicly available sources such as the US Census
Bureau, US Department of Agriculture, and National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration. The full Census data set,
including poverty, income, household size, transportation,
employment, and neighborhood characteristics, was
considered by the model. A few data elements are unclear in
the government references: neighborhood in-migration (the
percentage of households that have moved to the
neighborhood in the past 12 months), group living quarters
(individuals living in college residence halls, residential5/11/25, 8:51 PM Using Applied Machine Learning to Predict Healthcare Utilization Based on Socioeconomic Determinants of Care

treatment centers, skilled nursing facilities, group homes,
military barracks, correctional facilities, and workers’
dormitories), and purchasing channel preference (how
individuals shop [eg, over the internet]).
Behavioral data had been purchased from third-party data
vendors such as Acxiom, Experian, and TransUnion. Individual
behavioral data included elements such as history of internet
searches on health conditions, purchasing channels, and life
stage. All purchased data are indexes indicating preferences,
and no transactional-level data were used. The purpose of the
behavioral data is to enhance the model with individual
preferences and behaviors. Publicly available data had been
collected at the Census tract level, and behavioral data had
been collected at the individual level. Race was defined by the
race information provided by the health systems in their billing
data.
Outcome Measures
The principal outcome measures of this study were any
inpatient/ED utilization in 90 days (December 1, 2018, to
February 28, 2019). Secondary outcomes included inpatient
admission within 90 days, Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality—defined avoidable inpatient admission within 90 days,
and ED visit within 90 days.
Data Standards
Standard claim ontologies were used for billing data. Publicly
available data and purchased data were used in their native
form without transformation.325/11/25, 8:51 PM Using Applied Machine Learning to Predict Healthcare Utilization Based on Socioeconomic Determinants of Care

Machine Learning Appr oach
We split the patient population into 2 randomly selected
groups: 70.3% of the patient population (training data) and
29.7% of the patient population (testing data). A hold-out
methodology was used, meaning there was no overlap
between patients in the training and testing sets; a random
selection of patients was “held out” (ie, not included) in the
training of the model. Therefore, the performance of the model
could be tested on a completely independent set of subjects. A
proprietary decision tree methodology was used to make the
predictions. Decision trees are a group of supervised machine
learning approaches that predict outcomes by generating
potentially complex classification algorithms. Only the
socioeconomic features—age group, gender, and
race&mdash;were used in the prediction of a patient’s risk of
admission. No location data (ie, zip code, state, country) were
considered by the model in order to limit any impact that
regional differences in propensity of utilization might have on
the predictions. Claims data were also used to identify the
primary and secondary study outcomes.
Analysis
The performance of the machine learning algorithm to predict
which patients would have a primary outcome was determined
for both the training and testing sets. The area under the curve
(AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic was calculated
for both the training and testing sets for the primary outcome
of inpatient or ED utilization within 90 days, as well as for the
secondary outcomes of inpatient admission, avoidable
admission, and ED visit. The sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated
in the testing set for the primary and secondary outcomes5/11/25, 8:51 PM Using Applied Machine Learning to Predict Healthcare Utilization Based on Socioeconomic Determinants of Care

using a threshold of the top 30% highest-risk patients as the
at-risk population. The highest-weighted socioeconomic values
at the individual level were determined and aggregated across
the population to determine the features most associated with
determining risk.
RESULTS
The patients included in this study reflect a general population
of patients (Table 1), both pediatric and adult. The population
was 59.7% female and 61.1% Caucasian, and 85.4% of the
patients were adults (≥18 years). The primary outcome
occurred in 4.9% of the population.
The machine learning approach was able to predict utilization
with a high degree of discrimination (Table 2). The event rates
for inpatient hospitalization or ED visit, ED visit, inpatient
hospitalization, and avoidable inpatient hospitalization were
4.7%, 3.2%, 2.0%, and 1.5%, respectively. The AUC for the
primary outcome was 0.84 in the training set and 0.83 in the
testing set. The testing AUCs ranged from 0.78 to 0.84 for the
secondary outcomes. Sensitivity was 0.73 or greater for all
outcomes, and specificity was 0.71 or greater, when 30% of the
population was determined to be at risk of an event. The
sensitivity values of the predictions for inpatient hospitalization
or ED visit, ED visit, inpatient hospitalization, and avoidable
inpatient hospitalization were 0.79, 0.82, 0.73, and 0.75,
respectively.
Nineteen categories of SDH contributed to the branching of
the decision tree algorithm. The relative values of the SDH are
shown in Table 3. The SDH most associated with risk was air
quality, which had a relative value more twice that of the next
determinant, income. Air quality had a relative value more than5/11/25, 8:51 PM Using Applied Machine Learning to Predict Healthcare Utilization Based on Socioeconomic Determinants of Care
https://www.ajmc.com/view/using-applied-machine-learning-to-predict-healthcare-utilization-based-on-socioeconomic-determinants-of-care 9/28

30-fold higher than the lowest-weighted determinant,
percentage in group living quarters, which represents the
number of people who are not living in housing units and
instead are living in group quarters (eg, nursing homes,
missions, shelters). Both air quality and income were more
important to the decision-making capability of the model than
age, ethnicity, or gender. Neighborhood in-migration,
transportation, and purchasing channel preferences were more
important than ethnicity or gender. Only 3 socioeconomic
features influenced the model’s decision-making capability less
than gender: retail access, employment sector, and percentage
in group living quarters.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that it is possible to generate a highly
accurate model to predict inpatient and ED utilization using
decision tree—based machine learning with purchasable and
publicly available data on SDH. All the data used in the analysis
are available without collecting information directly from
patients. Therefore, this study indicates that it is possible to
risk-stratify patients’ risk of utilization without interacting with
the patient or collecting information beyond the patient’s age,
gender, race, and address. The implications of this application
are wide and have the potential to positively affect health
systems by facilitating targeted patient outreach with specific,
individualized interventions to tackle detrimental SDH at not
only the individual level but also the neighborhood level.
Multiple recent studies have found positive correlations
between poor air quality and increased utilization. A RAND
study of California in 2012 found that, from 2005 to 2007,
failure to meet federal clean air standards resulted in 29,808
hospitalizations and ED visits, with more than $190 million in33,345/11/25, 8:51 PM Using Applied Machine Learning to Predict Healthcare Utilization Based on Socioeconomic Determinants of Care
https://www.ajmc.com/view/using-applied-machine-learning-to-predict-healthcare-utilization-based-on-socioeconomic-determinants-of-care 10/28

costs from inpatient visits. It was expected that air quality
would be an important feature in determining risk, but the
finding that it was the top contributing feature was
unexpected. Air quality in this study includes factors that
consider both fine particles and ozone.
Low income and poverty are associated with poor health
outcomes and high healthcare utilization. In 2017, 39.7
million Americans lived in poverty in the United States.
Individuals living in impoverished neighborhoods have been
found to have lower health status and increased risk of mental
health problems compared with those in wealthy and well-
educated neighborhoods. Impoverished neighborhoods
commonly have limited resources, inadequate schools, crime,
and violence. Individual poverty is associated with negative
physiological responses from increased stress, including
increased blood pressure and cortisol levels. As expected,
income level is a highly ranked factor for predicting utilization.
In contrast, neighborhood in-migration and purchasing
channel preferences were, to our knowledge, not previously
identified as predictors of hospital or ED utilization. Given the
decision tree nature of the machine learning algorithm, it is
possible that neighborhood in-migration has a dual effect.
When it represents rapid growth, it may reduce the risk of
healthcare utilization. However, when it represents lack of
housing stability, it may increase an individual’s risk.
Inadequate transportation poses many barriers to accessible
healthcare, preventive screenings, and the management of
chronic conditions. Approximately 3 million children miss a
healthcare appointment each year because of inaccessible
transportation. These challenges are found in both rural and
urban communities, with both exhibiting lack of vehicle access,35

long travel distances, and extensive travel times. Overall, lack
of reliable transportation has been found to be associated with
poor health outcomes.
Purchasing channels reflect digital knowledge, digital access, or
simply behavioral preferences that translate to how individuals
interact with healthcare systems and providers. Various
research studies have identified that lack of digital access limits
the ability to use technology for health-related purposes and
prevents patients from using mobile technologies that support
healthy behaviors. Internet access and usage hold a direct
association with health literacy, which is the ability to
comprehend basic healthcare information and use it to make
informed healthcare decisions. Further investigation is
needed to determine how these characteristics contribute to an
individual patient’s risk.
The final 14 SDH categories, ranked by descending relative
value, were health literacy, population density, social support,
education, financial security, housing stability, food access,
employment opportunities, environmental health hazard
exposure, digital fluency, neighbor language (primary): English,
retail access, employment sector, and percentage in group
living quarters. Interactive relationships exist among SDH, such
as living in a high population density area, having low
education levels, and higher rates of poverty. That said, the
decision tree—based machine learning approach was able to
identify the relative values of these SDH categories.
Addressing the root cause of inequalities in the community
runs in parallel with solving nationwide health issues such as
food insecurity and limited access to care. Through the ACA,
nonprofit hospitals are required to conduct community health
needs assessments and construct community interventions43

every 3 years. The ACA-enacted tax exemption requirement
aids in encouraging accountability in these hospitals.
However, many hospitals and affiliated organizations may lack
the resources and competencies to strategically address
community health initiatives that commonly fall outside of
basic clinical care. Other technologies including EHRs are
making advances to collect patient-reported socioeconomic
determinants of care. However, these technologies have shown
little advancement in the ability to understand the effects of
socioeconomic determinants of care at the individual and
community levels. We envision these health systems to be
able to strategically target those initiatives with the technology
and methods included within this study. Integration would
consist of a simplistic geospatial visualization and be applied
across multiple clinical disciplines. Primary care workflows
would focus on the effort in reducing socioeconomic
disparities such as access to food, exposure to environmental
hazards, and access to transportation. A primary care physician
may use this as a tool to identify areas on which to focus
socioeconomic screening and topics to problem-solve
regarding overcoming barriers with patients. A community care
coordinator would find this technology useful for outreach
programs (eg, patient follow-up with prescribed diet). With
healthcare organizations spending millions of dollars on
treating those in the community and with federal policy
focusing on community impact, this type of solution ensures
maximum effectiveness for driving positive health-related
outcomes.
Finally, this approach to integrating SDH to assess risk of
healthcare utilization addresses limitations in many previous
studies. For example, this model has been developed using
almost 140,000 patients in both rural and urban settings in
multiple US regions, which increases the confidence in48,49

generalizability. Given that there is no additional
documentation required by clinicians, SDH can be considered
for holistic patient care without disruption to existing clinical
workflows and is not limited by variations in provider
documentation. Additionally, with no required assessment
and documentation of individual SDH, many more risk factors
can be integrated into the model for consideration, which can
more accurately identify the appropriate interventions at the
patient level.
Limitations
The patient population is based on a single month of active
encounters and includes patients from just 3 geographic areas.
The patient population may not be fully generalizable to the
US population because of the diversity across populations and
each community’s unique socioeconomic environment. Also,
the decision tree methodology determines only associates that
are predictive and does not mean that the identified factors are
causative. The lack of causation may limit the actionability of
this research.
CONCLUSIONS
This investigation demonstrates that it is possible to predict
hospital and ED utilization without data on clinical risk factors.
Instead, predictive features are based on publicly available
socioeconomic determinants of care and purchasable
behavioral data. This study highlights the significant influence
of SDH on individuals’ health and healthcare use. It is an
important advancement in tackling disparities in healthcare
because risk can be assessed without gathering information
directly from the patient and thus can be incorporated27,29
