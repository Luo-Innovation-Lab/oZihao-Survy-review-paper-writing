Abstract: The Quintuple Aim seeks to improve healthcare by addressing social determinants of health
(SDOHs), which are responsible for 70–80% of medical outcomes. SDOH-related concerns have
traditionally been addressed through referrals to social workers and community-based organizations
(CBOs), but these pathways have had limited success in connecting patients with resources. Given
that health inequity is expected to cost the United States nearly USD 300 billion by 2050, new
artificial intelligence (AI) technology may aid providers in addressing SDOH. In this commentary,
we present our experience with using ChatGPT to obtain SDOH management recommendations for
archetypal patients in Philadelphia, PA. ChatGPT identified relevant SDOH resources and provided
contact information for local organizations. Future exploration could improve AI prompts and
integrate AI into electronic medical records to provide healthcare providers with real-time SDOH
recommendations during appointments.

1. Introduction
The Quintuple Aim, established in 2021, adds health equity to the previous four
pillars of healthcare transformation: patient experience, outcomes, costs, and clinician well-
being [ 1,2]. This model arises from our contemporary understanding of social determinants
of health (SDOHs), which account for 70–80% of medical outcomes [ 2–4]. Particularly, the
COVID-19 pandemic highlighted prevalent health disparities and questioned the ethicality
of the current distributions of resources in our communities [ 5]. It also demonstrated that
equity would produce better health for all members of society [ 6]. Today, SDOHs are
understood to include housing, food, transportation, and more. Each of these impacts the
individual and greater society, with implications for the development and prognosis of
disease, access to care, and cost.
Health inequity is estimated to cost the U.S. nearly USD 300 billion annually by 2050 [ 2].
Health systems have invested increasing sums into social programming [ 7], and there is a
burgeoning private industry focused on tackling disparities for patients [ 4]. Additionally,
providers are increasingly expected to add SDOH management to their toolkit. Nonethe-
less, with demands on physicians’ time rising, overall medical knowledge expanding, and
burnout reaching historic levels, it is important to retain realistic expectations for individ-
ual physicians. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) may assist providers with
this rising challenge. AI has already shown wide potential for applications in healthcare,
including patient education, clinical decision-making support, documentation, and diag-
nostic assistance within radiology or pathology [ 8–12]. In this commentary, we present our
experience using ChatGPT, the leading generative AI model, to obtain SDOH management
recommendations for archetypal patients with health-related social needs reflective of
underlying SDOH disparities within our community of Philadelphia, PA.

2. ChatGPT Prompt Crafting, Selection, and Accuracy Confirmation
We utilized ChatGPT Version 3.5 to complete a case series evaluation of three archety-
pal “model patients” who required various SDOH interventions. The models were not
based on real patients but were instead designed empirically using commonly reported
social concerns among our patient population, which we believe are also applicable to
patients in other urban settings. We focused on housing, transportation, and nutritional
needs, which are the primary domains defined by Healthy People 2030 [13].
The questions for ChatGPT were developed empirically, framed as typical prompts
that would be written by an average physician. The structure of each prompt was as
follows: (1) a statement that the question comes from a physician, (2) a brief description
of the patient’s chief health complaint, (3) the background of the patient’s living situation
and health-related social need, (4) a statement of concern regarding the potential of these
needs (that reflect underlying SDOH disparity) to impact the patient’s health, and (5) a
request for specific instructions and contact information for resources to address the health-
related social need. This prompt structure was created empirically using plain language
in consultation with an internal-medicine physician. The patient’s chief health complaint
and comorbidities were selected using the most common causes of death, reasons for
hospitalization, comorbidities, and long-term diagnoses seen in the county of the study
team’s medical center; these were identified using the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s
Philadelphia county profile [ 14]. The three social needs were selected using the Healthy
People 2030 domains [ 13]. Standardized prompt questions were input into ChatGPT as a
question-based paragraph (Table 1). Given the stochasticity of sequential generative AI
chatbot responses, these prompts were only asked once, and the first response provided by
ChatGPT was utilized in the study.

The responses from ChatGPT were generated and reviewed to determine the accuracy
of the resources presented. Accuracy was determined by three independent reviewers
by confirming that (1) the suggested resources were correctly described and currently
operational and (2) the contact information was up to date and correct. The reviewers used
the Google search engine first to verify the existence of each suggested resource, and then
used that resource’s website, if available, to confirm the program’s mission and contact
information. If specific websites did not exist, Google was utilized to further verify this
organizational information.
3. Representative Responses Obtained from ChatGPT
3.1. Analysis of Responses
The responses are presented in Table 1. We found that ChatGPT was able to provide
resources relevant to our patients and local community, making recommendations for
specific local organizations and even providing contact information. Several resources
were provided for all three SDOH domains: housing, transportation, and nutrition. They
included multiple programs specific to Philadelphia. Further, they provided actionable ad-
vice for the physician, such as detailing the information needed in medical documentation,
and often provided contact information or website links for ease of access. Importantly,
this was not consistent for all resources, as some were missing phone numbers or website
links, and the amount of detail provided for each resource was variable. The order or style
of presentation also varied; for instance, websites were largely presented as hyperlinks in
the nutrition prompt, while they were given as complete URLs for the other domains.
3.2. Verification of Accuracy and Functionality of Resources
Upon performing an online review of the resources provided by ChatGPT, we found
100% of the resources provided to be correctly described, currently operational, and have
accurate and up-to-date contact information. There were no defunct, nonexistent, or
irrelevant resources provided by the AI chatbot, demonstrating that hallucinations may be
less likely in this context, though our small sample size is certainly a limitation.

4. Suggestions for Next Steps
4.1. Contemporary State of SDOH Intervention
Despite an evolving appreciation for SDOH and an understanding of their costs at
a systemic level, there has been little progress in tackling this issue. The current system
is likely necessitated by strict time constraints and demands on providers, who are often
permitted only 15 min per patient. Traditionally, SDOH-related considerations were han-
dled through referrals to social workers and community-based organizations (CBOs), as
providers felt poorly equipped to handle these challenges directly [ 15]. Unfortunately,
CBOs have struggled with funding, reimbursement, and the sharing of patient information,
thus hamstringing a potential source of progress backed by local support [4].
There is evidence that considering SDOH needs as a key component of patients’
care plans can improve outcomes and reduce spending [ 16,17]; this supports increasing
agreement that direct physician intervention in social needs is necessary to treat patients
holistically [ 7]. If SDOH truly impact such a large portion of medical outcomes, a culture
shift is necessary to ensure that physicians address these factors as strongly as they address
biomedical considerations. If physicians are given an efficient and accurate method to
identify available resources appropriate to their patients, the burden of referrals and
necessary legwork for social workers can be reduced. While our model will not directly
tackle the social challenges faced by patients, it can offer an effective first step—one that at
least allows for the identification of appropriate resources that the patient can then receive
assistance in pursuing.
Under the current screening and referral system, there is a limited success rate in
connecting patients with SDOH resources due to inconsistent screening mechanisms [ 18].
Both screening and intervention often must be performed manually by providers during
exceedingly short patient interactions. Studies of the success of SDOH interventions are
few. Even at Kaiser Permanente, recognized as a leader in value-based care and health
equity, only 23% of referrals resulted in patients’ needs being addressed in the Pacific
Northwest [ 19], while only 10% succeeded in Southern California [ 20]. Nationally, the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services supported a project that screened 1.1 million
patients for SDOH needs, but only 14% of those patients received a resolution [ 21]. Patients
who did receive assistance demonstrated significantly reduced emergency department
visits and costs [ 21]. The reasons for this suboptimal success are unclear and may be
attributed to poor patient engagement and difficult navigation, along with low perceived
importance of these factors by patients and providers alike. These data indicate that health
systems must incorporate SDOH management into more routine healthcare practice instead
of devolving to third parties.
4.2. Potential for AI Solutions
One existing high-quality platform is Findhelp.org, a free search engine that allows
patients to quickly locate social service providers in their region. NowPow is a similar
program which simplifies referrals and care coordination with community programs,
though it is limited to Chicago. We believe that our new AI model offers great potential;
with further training, it may provide a similar service to Findhelp.org and NowPow. Future
studies may compare the quality of content provided by ChatGPT versus these existing
third-party platforms. It is possible that with development, AI can reduce friction via
seamless integration into existing physician or patient portals, the automated generation
of suggestions and the verification of patient eligibility, and the greater personalization of
results; importantly, these features are not currently available. This model can eliminate
the need for a middleman and allows physicians to directly intervene without significant
burdens on their time. Further, a chatbot platform design is more user-friendly and intuitive,
and likely cost-effective as it does not require live staff for database maintenance.
With proper oversight, user training, and further research, medicine can leverage AI
to safely augment care quality, facilitate burdensome tasks, and increase face-to-face time
with patients [ 8–12]. These tasks have already been demonstrated [ 8–12]; in parallel, the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024 ,21, 718 6 of 8
existing literature suggests that AI may eventually automatically screen patient charts for
SDOH needs, freeing up time during short appointments to discuss this important topic,
and tracking patients’ success in navigating resources. This may be beneficial for adherence
to all of the Quintuple Aim pillars. Of course, our study does not investigate each these
potential uses, but indicates that future study into these realms would be warranted.
Certainly, policymakers must collaborate with providers to refine and expand social
services that integrate with health. Of course, several excellent services are already available,
yet they are little accessed due to bureaucratic complexity and nebulous qualification
criteria. Moreover, resources continuously change with policy and economics. Nationally,
there are a variety of services, including financial assistance, food and housing waivers,
childcare, utility assistance, and Medicaid. State and local resources vary widely and cannot
be adequately discussed in brief publications or provider educational material. Hence, AI
can quickly provide physicians with a list of the optimal resources which the physician–
patient partnership may then pursue. A future study may include patient-specific qualifiers
in the prompt and request that ChatGPT evaluate them for eligibility. Of course, our AI
model cannot force the actual connection of a patient with a service, and it is limited to the
confines of those resources which already exist.
4.3. Cautions for AI Implementation
Nuances in SDOH intervention are rarely, if ever, taught in medical school. It is difficult
for a provider, within the short appointment they are allocated, to evaluate a patient for
minute qualification criteria and decide the best resource for them. Resources or paperwork
that can make a profound difference with a simple physician’s signature are often little
known [ 7]. AI has shown great skill in synthesizing many data points, integrating them,
and subsequently providing a range of recommendations. Importantly, providing a list
of SDOH-related services or organizations is simply the first step and is not sufficient in
effectively addressing current inequities. There remains a need to improve the tracking
of successful referrals and their impact on health outcomes to truly measure the impact
of these interventions. Structural competency training amongst physicians to help them
operationalize these resources is necessary as well, ensuring that physicians work with
their patients to implement AI-generated advice while tackling potential obstacles [22].
Of note, there are considerations regarding the limitations of AI. There is extensive
literature highlighting the potential for hallucinations, and repeated questioning may yield
slightly different responses due to the nature of generative AI [ 23]. Rarely, this has been
shown to contain inaccuracies or misinformation. Further, our study only utilized one
style of empiric prompting; further study is necessary to compare results amongst different
prompting styles to determine how physicians may craft the most effective questions.
Finally, our study did not directly verify the availability and quality of AI-recommended
resources with the organizations themselves. Additional studies may include direct com-
munication with the suggested organizations, consultations with local stakeholders, and
the assessment of service quality through patient surveys or data analyses of outcomes.
Because AI is based on real-life data, there is potential for the reinforcement of in-
equity [ 24]. For instance, the model could learn from online data rooted in structural racism
and subsequently make decisions that perpetuate unfairness. A previous study supported
this theory that algorithms underlying technological automation may exacerbate existing
biases and discrimination; the design of novel tools requires more conscious considera-
tion of systemic racism to prevent this pitfall [ 24]. The development of new technologies
in healthcare must emphasize justice and fairness for all patients. Similarly, historically
discriminated-against groups may be less inclined to trust AI, while young and healthy
patients gravitate toward this new technology. Nonetheless, studies have shown that
patients with underlying social needs have preferred AI interventions to the standard of
care [ 25]. As AI becomes widely available and used in real practice, further refinement can
allow it to make physicians’ jobs easier and patients’ experiences more fulfilling.

5. Conclusions
Greater adherence to the Quintuple Aim requires commitment by providers to address
SDOHs via direct interventions. This presents a unique challenge given the burden of
obligation already placed on providers regarding patients’ immediate care needs. The
integration of artificial intelligence technology is a potential solution to aid providers
in managing SDOH-related challenges beyond the screen-and-refer method that has not
sufficiently met patients’ needs. Additional studies are necessary to develop this model,
determine its limitations, and reduce the risk of the potential exacerbation of inequity for
marginalized populations.
