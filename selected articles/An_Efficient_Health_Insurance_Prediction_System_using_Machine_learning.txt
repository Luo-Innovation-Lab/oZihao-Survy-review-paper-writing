Abstract- Health insurance policies provide financial 
assistance to cover medical expenses and mitigate the 
financial impact of illnesses. Various factors contributes the 
cost of healthcare and health insurance. Predicting health 
insurance costs early can assist in determining the 
appropriate coverage amount and identifying potential 
benefits. ML can improve the efficiency of insurance policy  
in the insurance industry. In healthcare, ML algorithms 
excel at forecasting high-cost medical expenses. Machine 
learning can enhance the effectiveness of insurance program 
language within the insurance sector. In the Insurance 
business Machine Learning (ML) algorithms help to 
anticipate and make the process effortless between the 
policyholder and the insurer as the distance has been zeroed 
with the help of technology in the form of digital insurance. 
In contrast to traditionally available health insurance Digital 
insurance with the help of AI, ML help to predict the value 
required to be insured of a specific individual based on 
factors such as age, gender, BMI, Smoking routine, 
geographical location, and the number of children. Hence 
Model using XGBRF Regressor is trained to foretell the 
minimum insurance premium for an individual. 
 
Keywords: Machine learning (ML), Health insurance,

I. INTRODUCTION  
 
In a world filled with Uncertainty, all forms of life are 
subjected to a variety of risk factors. The primary concern 
is the threat caused due to illness or prolonged illness 
leading to death. Hence, the Effects of illness worsen with 
the financial inability of a person to accommodate 
Medicare. This issue can be foreseen and effectively 
handled with the help of investing in health insurance. A 
Policy that helps to cover all the expenses related to 
Medicare is called health insurance after paying the 
premium for a specific tenure of time. It helps to reduce or 
eliminate the expenses incurred by various risk factors. 
The major difficulty with handling health insurance is the 
inability to predict a specific premium for yearly 
installments. Hence by using Machine learning algorithms 
a predefined amount can be derived to give the user an 
estimate to be invested for healthcare to their future 
benefit. Medical insurance helps in the deduction of 
expenses incurred due to various health-related risk factors and forecasting a healthcare cost helps to improve 
accountability in the medical sector. The Premium of an 
individual varies and can be estimated on a collection of 
factors such as age, gender, locality, etc.  Example: The 
premium amount of individuals older than 50 years is 
more when compared to young adults since the probability 
of health complications is high in them.  
 
Medical expenses are a significant and frequently 
recurring cost in human existence. An individual's lifestyle 
and various physical factors determine the illnesses or 
conditions they may experience, which in turn impact their 
healthcare costs. 
 
The increasing occurrence of unpredictable diseases and 
accidents has led to a substantial rise in the demand for 
health insurance. Health insurance plans serve as a means 
to alleviate the financial burden during medical 
emergencies. Individuals, at all stages of life, must contend 
with uncertainties and risks. Numerous factors contribute 
to the determination of healthcare insurance costs. 
Machine Learning algorithms have been extensively 
employed across various domains, leveraging extensive 
data for predictive purposes with notably high accuracy 
rates. One significant application is the estimation of 
hospital expenses within the realm of healthcare.This 
document covers related research,  the methodology,  the 
results, and the conclusion. 
 
II.R ELATED WORK  
 
Ahmed I. Taloba et.al worked on a multiview learning 
architecture that helped to predict one of the best methods 
used for the prediction of medical care expenses incurred 
due to hospitalization. They studied the various key 
factors to be considered for medical care and 
hospitalization with one of them being BMI (Body Mass 
Index) based on which obesity was determined that serves 
one of the root causes of major health problems. Out of 
themachine learning algorithms employed, namely 
random forest, linear regression analysis, and naive Bayes 
classifier, linear regression demonstrated the highest 
accuracy in predicting healthcare costs as a whole. [1].

2 Keshav Kaushi k et.al recommended the integration of ML 
andAIinto the prediction of healthcare insurance 
premiums. The model was the key factor for the 
emergence of digital health insurance that narrows down 
the possible distance between the consumer and the policy 
issuer and helps to ease the process of documentation 
where the services are even at a faster rate but their 
trained model deployed the use of ANN based regression 
network that obtained higher levels of accuracy with an 
r2_score of 0.75 considering the key per formance metrics 
such as age, BMI, Smoker, number of children and 
geolocation [2].  
 
Ch. Anwar ul Hassan et.al suggested the utilization of 
machine learning techniques for predicting health 
insurance premiums. Their study involved a comparison 
of various al gorithms, including Linear Regression, 
Support Vector Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest 
Regressor, and KNN. The model predicted higher 
accuracy rates using SGB on the dataset that was used for 
training and testing from Kaggle [3].  
 
M. A. Aefa and colleagu es present two techniques for 
parameter estimation in the mixture model: the maximum 
likelihood method and the Bayesian method. The 
maximum likelihood method centers on identifying 
parameter values that optimize the likelihood function, 
representing the pr obability of observing the data given 
those parameters. Conversely, the Bayesian method 
focuses on determining the posterior distribution of the 
parameters, which reflects the probability of the 
parameters in light of the data and additional prior 
informat ion [4].  
 
The prevalence of obesity and weight gain among the 
population leads to an increase in health risks which is a 
major concern and also an essential parameter to be 
considered to evaluate the health premium [ 5] 
 
R. A. Ganaie  et.al proposed a new distribution called the 
weighted power Shanker distribution that can model 
various lifetime data. The paper explores its properties and 
applications and shows that it outperforms some existing 
distributions [6].  
 
J. Liu, D. Capurro et.al introduced a new way for 
parameter calculation of the generalized exponential 
distribution using record values. The paper derives the 
likelihood function and compares the method with existing 
ones using simulation and real data [7].  
 
H. N. Alhazmi et .al introduced a predictive model aimed 
at estimating healthcare expenses for organizations 
resembling orphanages in Saudi Arabia. This predictive 
model has the added benefit of assisting orphanages in 
forecasting healthcare costs. It aids in determining t he 
approximate government funding required for the welfare 
of orphans and abandoned children through the utilization of Machine Learning, Business Analytics, Naive Bayes, 
and Simple Linear Regression. Among these approaches, 
the combination of Random Fores t and business analytics 
yielded the highest level of accuracy. [8].  
 
M. H. Abu -Moussa  et.al applied the weighted power 
Shanker distribution to three real life data sets related to 
the lifetime of electronic components, the time to failure of 
mechanical s ystems, and the survival time of patients with 
lung cancer [9].  
 
S. Sana  et.alstudied and solved the problem of estimating 
and predicting the parameters of the generalized 
exponential distribution using lower record values. The 
authors compare the maximum likelihood and Bayesian 
methods using simulation and real data [10].  
 
M. Ravaut, H. Sadeghi, K. K. Leung et al., proposed the 
model that could be used to identify individuals at high 
risk of developing diabetes complications. These 
individuals could then b e targeted with preventive 
interventions, such as lifestyle changes or early medical 
treatment. The model could also be used to identify 
individuals who have already developed diabetes 
complications. These individuals could then be monitored 
more closely a nd provided with more intensive care [11].  
 
Jeremy A. Irvin et.al incorporated machine learning along 
with Social Determinants of Health (SDH) to enhance risk 
adjustments for effective payment details of a health plan. 
It often targets budgetary needs and provides better care 
for high -risk individuals using the linear regression 
method. Risk modeling is done to provide better 
healthcare services [12].  
 
Akashdeep Bhardwaj et.al used Artificial Neural 
Networks (ANN) for Health insurance claim prediction. It 
was aimed to foretell the anticipated medical claims that 
would occur in a year for a specific medical health 
insurance company that helped to include prefix amounts 
in their annual budgets. The recurrent neural network 
aided various business organizations in decision making 
that helps to increase the profit margin of the company To 
overcome the dilemma of accurate investment aggregate, 
we can integrate(ML), and Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN) models to predict these costs and simplify 
investment in the heal th insurance field since it is a 
mandatory investment to be made by any individual [13].  
 
Reliability in prediction also plays a vital role where the 
growth of a model is unrecognized until validated for a 
particular data set [14].  
 
L.Hu et.al uses machine  learning to identify and rank the 
determinants of high healthcare costs for breast cancer 
patients. They compared different models and finds that 
deep neural network is the best [15].

3 M. Shyamala Devi et.al proposed a medical insurance 
prediction model u sing linear and ensemble regression 
techniques to provide accuracy. Finding a random target 
on multiple lines with multiple searchers is the problem 
that studies and solves. It deployed the use of the UCI 
machine repository to analyze the data, compare the  
mechanisms such as polynomial regression, and random 
forest regression, and obtain results. Random forest 
mechanism provided higher accuracy results for the 
particular repository with R2Score evaluated as a 
parameter before and after scaling [16].  
 
Hong J . Kan et.al used machine learning in risk 
adjustments towards predicting health insurance costs for 
adults. The model implemented Lasso regression which 
provided superior prediction results with high accuracy 
that serves as a boon for policy providers to h elp the risk 
population for the benefit [17].  
 
Based on the related works inputs were taken to 
incorporate an efficient machine learning algorithm to 
provide accurate prediction results for estimating the 
health insurance of an individual.  
 
III.M ETHODOLOGY  
 
Dataset Description:  
The dataset employed in this study was obtained from 
Kaggle and exhibits no instances of missing or undefined 
values. It pertains to Insurance Premium Charges within 
the United States and consists of 1338 rows of insured 
individuals'  data, all of which are valid, with Insurance 
charges associated with specific attributes of the insured.

Data Pre -processing:  
Data Pre -processing is a necessary process to build an 
ideal model. It makes the input data suitable for our 
machine learning model. The Dataset Contains both 
Categorical (Categorized into some groups) and 
Numerical values which is difficult for a model to  predict. 
Hence, data are normalized (organizes data for more 
efficient access), which converts the values in a range 
between -1.0 to 1.0 or 0.0 to 1.0.   
 
Data Normalization is done by type cast the data into a 
specified type such as float, double, etc. T ype casting is 
the process of converting a value into another format.  
 
The Categorical values are Smoker, Sex, and Region and 
the Numerical values are Age, BMI, Children, and 
charges. All these values were normalized into type float.  
 
Feature Engineering:  
It is the process of finding the best features that have a 
positive influence on the prediction of the target value.  
We performed Feature Selection with the help of the 
Correlation Matrix.  
 
Correlation Matrix:  
Fig 1.A correlation matrix is essentially a tabular 
representation illustrating the relationships between 
different features and target variables. In this context, we 
calculated the correlation using Pearson's correlation 
coefficient, determined through the provided formula.  
ð=ð(âð¥ð¦)â(âð¥)(âð¦)
 [ðâð¥2â(âð¥)2][ðâð¦2â(âð¦)2] 
 
In this context, "n" denotes the amount of information, 
"Î£x" stands for the cumulative total of the first variable's 
values, "Î£y" represents the cumulative total of the second 
variable's values, "Î£xy" indicates the summation of the 
product of the first and second values, "Î£x2" refers to the 
cumulative total of the squares of the first value, and 
"Î£y2" signifies the cumulative total of the squares of the 
second value.  
 
Correlation Matrix for features and target:  
Here n=1338 and  X values are age, BMI, region, smoker, 
children, sex and Y value is Charges. With the help of the 
correlation matrix, we found that the feature âregionâ is 
negatively correlated with the charges. So, we removed 
that feature, since itâs not contributing to  the target 
variable. Some other features like sex, and children 
contribute less to the target variable. We decided to 
include those features since they are not making such a 
huge difference as the feature 'region'.

Splitting the input data:  
The input data was divided into training and testing sets 
following the Pareto Principle, allocating 80% of the data 
to the training part and 20% to the test part. The random 
nature of this split was employed to ensure the model's 
impartiality and prevent bias towards specific data. The 
model was then trained on the training set and assessed 
using XGBRFRegressor, which combines the Random 
Forest algorithm with XGBOOST.  
 
A Random Forest serves as a meta -estimator by fitting 
multiple decision trees for class ification on subsets of the 
dataset, utilizing averaging to address overfitting and 
improve predictive accuracy. When combined with 
XGBOOST, it aids in prioritizing the features used to 
forecast health insurance premiums. It measures the extent 
to which th e output variable can be predicted from the 
input independent variables and assesses how closely the 
model replicates observed results based on the degree of 
variance explained by the model. It's important to note that 
our model doesn't provide an exact ag gregate value for any 
health insurance company but offers a general estimate of 
the investment required for an individual's health 
insurance  
.

IV.R ESULTS  
 
XGBRFRegressor has been applied to predict the premium 
incurred for an individual. Based on validation and testing, 
the model has achieved  R2_score= 87.34% in Fig 3, Mean 
Absolute Error (MAE) = 2511.03 in Fig 4, Mean Squared 
Error (MSE) = 19429024.51 in Fig 5. This model wa s 
implemented on a 12 GB RAM machine with 107 GB 
storage. The model developed is inexpensive and 
accessible to all.  We have also hosted a 
website( https://health -insurance -predictor -
k19.streamlit.app/ ) for individuals to get an idea about the 
premium amoun t based on input values such as age, 
gender, BMI, Number of children , smoker and region 
where the categorical and non -categorical  data are 
converted to float values on which XGBRFRegressor is 
applied and their health insurance aggregate amount will 
be pr edicted (Fig 6). We have run different algorithms on 
the data set that we have obtained from Kaggle and have 
got better R2_score can be viewed in the tabular column 
listed below for XGBRFRegressor in Table II.

V.C ONCLUSION  
 
The Research focuses on machine learning algorithms that 
can be used for effective price prediction along with 
XGBRFRegressor which helps to prioritize the parameters 
used for prediction. The findings that are listed in the table 
II shows that XGBRFRegressor p rovides better accuracy 
than other machine learning models with a R2_score= 
87.34%. XGBRFRegressor can therefore be used to 
predict and estimate the insurance cost when compared to 
other machine learning models. ML reduces the amount of 
effort incorporated  in policy making it helps to estimate 
the premium on an individual in a sort span of time. It 
helps to work with enormous amount of data and also 
assist the users efficiently.
