# Social Determinants of Health and AI/ML for Predictive Modeling: A Comprehensive Review

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context and Background

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has progressively transformed from a nascent field of academic inquiry to a driving force behind healthcare innovation and precision medicine. This evolution has been propelled by the widespread adoption of cutting-edge analytics and computational technologies across virtually all sectors of healthcare delivery [1,2]. Within this broader AI landscape, predictive modeling has emerged as a distinctive and transformative application, fundamentally altering clinical decision-making workflows and patient risk stratification approaches across numerous medical domains [3,5].

While traditional healthcare analytics primarily excelled at retrospective analysis and basic classification tasks, modern AI/ML approaches represent a significant advancement through their capability to predict future outcomes rather than merely analyze past patterns. Predictive modeling in healthcare refers to "a class of machine learning technologies that can forecast clinical events and outcomes by analyzing patterns in existing patient data" [29]. This predictive capacity has transformed clinical risk assessment, becoming a topic of considerable medical and societal importance [23]. The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subfield of AI focused on understanding and generating human language, provides much of the foundation for extracting valuable insights from unstructured clinical documentation, including information about social determinants of health [40,38].

Recent advancements in healthcare AI models have precipitated a fundamental paradigm shift in clinical prediction, offering a distinctly different approach by generating holistic patient risk profiles that incorporate social and environmental factors rather than relying solely on traditional clinical parameters [25,26]. While medical predictive modeling as a discipline spans mere decades, the SDOH-enhanced AI models emerging in recent years demand an entirely new conceptual framework for how health risks are identified, evaluated, understood, and mitigated [30,46].

This paradigm shift manifests through several key transformations. Traditional health prediction systems typically relied on explicit, transparent, and interpretable mechanisms such as clinical scores, physiological indices, and simplified risk algorithms. In contrast, modern AI/ML models incorporating SDOH data often demonstrate more complex architectures—featuring multidimensional interactions, non-linear relationships, and sometimes decreased interpretability, bearing more resemblance to the complex social-biological interplay that drives health outcomes than to their algorithmic predecessors [32]. Moreover, while conventional clinical prediction systems were designed for evaluation against specific outcomes or conditions, SDOH-enhanced AI models aim at general performance capabilities across diverse patient populations and clinical scenarios. This enables them to handle incompletely specified and open-ended clinical challenges, from predicting hospital readmissions to identifying candidates for preventive interventions or generating personalized treatment recommendations [45,19].

Even the fundamental methodologies of healthcare prediction have evolved in response to these new capabilities. The traditional approach of developing risk scores based on limited clinical variables no longer applies in the same manner. Contemporary SDOH-enhanced models analyze virtually unlimited data dimensions, making it possible to capture the complex interplay between clinical, behavioral, and social factors. Consequently, traditional evaluation metrics like c-statistics alone fail to capture the full spectrum of capabilities that define modern predictive healthcare systems [43]. This convergence of SDOH data and artificial intelligence represents a transformative development in healthcare analytics and precision medicine [8]. The technological and methodological analysis of SDOH-enhanced prediction systems highlights how these innovative approaches catalyze the development of interconnected clinical and public health interventions by "expanding the adjacent possible" in medical and technological fields [25].

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in healthcare has ushered in a new era of innovation across various clinical domains [44]. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence-based Clinical Decision Support Systems (AI-CDSS) have gained attention far beyond the medical informatics community, with healthcare systems at large becoming increasingly interested in predictive tools built by major technology companies and academic medical centers [34]. Moreover, at the technical core of this revolution are deep learning models, which have emerged as sophisticated architectures capable of generating novel insights based on existing patient data patterns [4]. These models function by discerning complex relationships from vast datasets and utilizing this knowledge to produce accurate and clinically relevant predictions [29]. Fueled by advancements in deep learning techniques, these systems push the boundaries of what machines can predict, blurring the lines between human clinical judgment and machine-generated recommendations [3].

Social determinants of health (SDOH) represent a critical dimension within this evolving predictive landscape. SDOH are defined as "the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age that shape health outcomes" [7]. These factors operate at multiple levels—from individual circumstances to community resources and broader societal policies—collectively influencing health risks, care access, treatment efficacy, and long-term outcomes [10,11]. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have established frameworks for systematically categorizing SDOH domains [12]. The CDC framework, which is widely adopted in the United States, delineates five key domains:

1. **Economic Stability**: Employment, income, expenses, debt, and financial support
2. **Education Access and Quality**: Literacy, education level, vocational training, and early childhood education
3. **Healthcare Access and Quality**: Insurance coverage, provider availability, healthcare costs, and quality of care
4. **Neighborhood and Built Environment**: Housing quality, transportation options, safety, environmental conditions, and food availability
5. **Social and Community Context**: Social integration, support systems, community engagement, discrimination, and incarceration history [13]

These domains represent the multifaceted nature of social factors that contribute to health disparities and outcomes, forming a conceptual foundation for integrating SDOH into AI/ML healthcare applications [14,15].

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become particularly prominent within the healthcare AI ecosystem as tools for extracting SDOH information from clinical documentation. These specialized AI frameworks, trained on massive corpora of text data, enable extraction of SDOH information from unstructured notes with remarkable proficiency [26]. They play a foundational role in the broader landscape of healthcare predictive capabilities, demonstrating unprecedented abilities in understanding and structuring information about patients' social circumstances and environmental exposures [38]. Building upon these text-focused foundations, multimodal AI approaches have further extended the reach and impact of SDOH-enhanced predictive technologies by incorporating additional data sources such as medical imaging, sensor data, and geospatial information [45].

### 1.2 Significance and Impact

The transformative nature of SDOH-enhanced predictive modeling is perhaps most clearly evidenced by its substantial potential for addressing health disparities and its rapidly expanding influence across medical specialties. Beyond the technical advancements discussed previously, SDOH-AI integration's significance manifests in quantifiable health impact metrics and cross-specialty applications that are reshaping clinical strategies.

Health disparities linked to social factors represent one of the most pressing challenges in modern healthcare systems. In the United States, socioeconomic status remains strongly correlated with mortality rates, with individuals in the lowest income quartile experiencing 4.5 years shorter life expectancy than those in the highest quartile [16]. Similar disparities exist across racial and ethnic groups, geographic regions, and education levels [17].

Recent financial projections highlight SDOH-enhanced AI's potential to fundamentally transform healthcare economics. Health economists suggest that addressing social determinants through targeted interventions could reduce healthcare expenditures by approximately 11% [18]. The economic burden of health inequities is substantial, with estimates suggesting that disparities cost the U.S. healthcare system approximately $93 billion in excess medical care costs and $42 billion in lost productivity annually [18]. As noted by Hacker [19], "The cost of chronic disease worldwide is estimated to reach $47 trillion by 2030," with a disproportionate burden falling on socially disadvantaged populations.

Investment patterns further illuminate SDOH-AI's growing importance within the healthcare ecosystem. Venture capital and healthcare system investment have flowed aggressively into the SDOH technology sector, with global investments reaching significant levels in recent years [27]. The broader market valuation reflects these investment trends, with the healthcare AI market incorporating SDOH data valued at approximately $20 billion in 2024 and projected to exceed $50 billion by 2030 [27]. This rapid valuation growth underscores the extraordinary confidence in SDOH-enhanced AI's potential to generate significant clinical improvements and economic returns across diverse healthcare settings.

The adoption patterns of SDOH-enhanced AI across medical specialties further reinforce its growing significance. In cardiovascular medicine and emergency care, early adoption has been particularly pronounced, with numerous studies demonstrating improved risk prediction when incorporating social determinants [25,8]. More broadly, expanding implementation across specialties suggests that SDOH-enhanced prediction's penetration spans well beyond initial pilot applications. Even in traditionally conservative fields such as surgical risk assessment, empirical studies have identified practical use cases already in implementation [30].

The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the critical importance of SDOH, as populations with adverse social determinants experienced significantly higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality [21,22]. This stark demonstration of inequality has accelerated interest in leveraging AI/ML approaches to identify vulnerable populations for targeted interventions and policy responses.

Beyond general market trends, specialty-specific applications highlight the targeted impact of SDOH-enhanced AI across medical fields. In the cardiovascular domain, models incorporating neighborhood disadvantage indices and food access metrics have demonstrated significantly improved prediction of adverse outcomes [25]. Similarly, in emergency medicine, SDOH-enhanced prediction has shown particular promise for identifying patients at risk for frequent emergency department utilization and hospital readmission [8]. These specialty-specific applications demonstrate how SDOH-AI integration is not merely a general-purpose approach but one that is being strategically customized to the specific clinical challenges and patient populations across diverse medical domains.

The intersection of SDOH awareness and AI/ML capabilities represents a promising frontier in healthcare innovation. The adoption of AI/ML in healthcare prediction has grown exponentially, with a 48% increase in related publications between 2019 and 2024 [23]. Within this expanding field, models incorporating SDOH data have demonstrated enhanced predictive performance across diverse clinical scenarios, with improvements in AUC ranging from 0.03 to 0.15 across various studies [46].

SDOH-enhanced predictive models offer particular promise for addressing health disparities by identifying high-risk individuals for targeted interventions, informing resource allocation, and supporting more equitable healthcare delivery [25]. As Gu and colleagues [26] demonstrated, large language models can now accurately extract SDOH information from clinical notes with F1 scores exceeding 0.96, enabling scalable approaches to incorporating these critical factors into clinical decision-making. Similarly, NLP models in emergency medicine have displayed significant predictive performance with F1-scores ranging between 0.40 and 0.75 and specificities nearing 95.9% [8].

Both industry and academia have shown growing interest in this field, with venture capital investment in SDOH-focused healthcare startups increasing substantially in recent years [27]. Federal research funding has similarly expanded, with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) allocating increasing resources to SDOH-related research initiatives [28]. The cross-sector impact of SDOH-AI extends beyond market valuations to practical applications and functional transformations in clinical care, population health management, and health policy formulation.

### 1.3 Healthcare System Context

Healthcare systems worldwide are undergoing significant digital transformation, spurred by the broader technological revolution seen in other industries. Intelligent computing, machine learning, and AI are becoming central to this transformation, even though healthcare historically has been slower to adopt these technologies compared to sectors like finance and retail [34]. The digital transformation of healthcare systems at all levels has created new clinical workflows and decision support systems commonly referred to as AI-enabled healthcare [2].

From an economic perspective, the healthcare AI industry has developed considerably in the last decade. According to recent analyses, the global healthcare AI market was projected to exceed $45 billion by 2026 [23]. This growth reflects how new technologies have fundamentally transformed healthcare since the late 2010s, accelerating radical changes in clinical practice during the first half of the 2020s [3]. Bibliometric analysis of subject areas related to AI in healthcare shows that computer science, medicine, engineering, and mathematics contribute more than two-thirds of the total academic contributions in this field, with medical informatics representing particularly valuable input for AI-based healthcare applications [46].

Traditional clinical risk prediction approaches have primarily relied on physiological parameters, laboratory values, and diagnostic codes to forecast patient outcomes [29]. While these models have demonstrated utility in specific clinical contexts, they often fail to capture the complex social factors that influence health trajectories outside clinical settings [30]. The limitations of clinical-only predictive models are increasingly recognized. As McNeill and colleagues [25] observed, "efforts to address SDOH have been hindered by lack of knowledge about how SDOH compounds problems of access and treatment, as well ways in which SDOH may be practically addressed." Models that exclude SDOH data may perform adequately for population-level prediction but often fail to generalize across diverse patient groups or to identify the underlying mechanisms driving disparities [32].

The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed what has been described as "the largest live experiment of data-driven healthcare decision-making in human history" [21]. When the pandemic revealed stark disparities in outcomes across different demographic groups and communities, approximately 60% of these differences were attributed to social determinants rather than clinical factors alone [22]. This unprecedented situation accelerated the adoption of SDOH-enhanced predictive technologies and permanently transformed approaches to healthcare risk assessment across many nations [20].

Despite technological advancements, significant gaps and challenges persist in integrating SDOH data into predictive healthcare models. One fundamental issue lies in the inconsistent documentation and standardization of social factors. For instance, while many health systems claim to collect SDOH data, they employ widely divergent documentation practices and terminologies, making it unclear what constitutes comprehensive SDOH assessment. Similarly, while housing instability appears in countless risk assessment frameworks, what this encompasses varies considerably across institutions [40].

The integration of SDOH data into healthcare predictive models faces several significant barriers. Foremost among these is data fragmentation, as relevant information often exists across disparate systems including EHRs, claims databases, public health records, community resource registries, and census data [14,36]. This fragmentation complicates comprehensive data collection and model development. Data standardization represents another substantial challenge. While clinical data benefits from established terminologies like ICD-10 and SNOMED CT, SDOH information lacks comparable standardization, leading to inconsistent documentation and variable interpretability across healthcare settings [37]. As Scherbakov and colleagues [38] noted, "Despite the clear relevance of SDOH to mental health, their underutilization presents a gap in current research."

EHR integration presents additional challenges, as healthcare data systems were not initially designed to systematically collect or utilize SDOH information [33]. Despite these challenges, healthcare analytics is progressively shifting toward more holistic patient understanding that incorporates both clinical and social factors [34]. Provider adoption barriers further complicate SDOH integration, as clinicians often lack the time, training, or incentives to systematically collect social determinants data during patient encounters [39]. When SDOH information is documented, it frequently appears in unstructured clinical notes rather than in structured fields amenable to algorithmic analysis [40].

Beyond these specific integration issues, broader systemic challenges include resistance to workflow change, insufficient data science expertise, inadequate computational infrastructure, and outdated reimbursement models. Perhaps most concerning is the significant risk of algorithmic bias when SDOH data is incorporated without careful consideration of representation and fairness, creating a danger of "algorithmic redlining" whereby predictive models inadvertently perpetuate rather than remedy health disparities [41,24,43]. These ethical dimensions require careful navigation to ensure that SDOH-enhanced prediction models promote rather than undermine health equity.

### 1.4 Research Scope and Objectives

The integration of SDOH-based AI/ML offers several significant advantages over traditional clinical prediction models. Research by McNeill et al. [25] reported that SDOH-enhanced models improve cardiovascular risk prediction across diverse populations, while Gu et al. [26] demonstrated that LLM-based extraction enables scalable access to previously inaccessible social determinant data. Studies by Abbott et al. [8] showed that SDOH-AI integration in emergency settings leads to more effective resource allocation and targeted interventions, while research by Rashid et al. [45] indicated that multimodal data pipelines incorporating SDOH lead to more comprehensive patient profiles.

SDOH-enhanced AI offers four key advantages over traditional clinical prediction approaches. First, these systems provide enhanced generalizability through incorporation of non-clinical factors that mediate health outcomes across diverse populations. Second, they create improved risk stratification via more comprehensive patient profiles that capture both medical and social vulnerability. Third, they deliver advanced population health management with community-level insights that support both individual care planning and public health interventions. Fourth, they increase health equity by explicitly accounting for social factors that contribute to disparities, enabling more targeted allocation of healthcare resources to vulnerable populations.

In clinical practice specifically, SDOH-AI can act as both a risk identification tool and intervention guide, providing personalized and targeted approaches to patient care, increasing the precision of resource allocation, supporting diverse patient populations, offering more holistic patient assessment, and informing both individual treatment plans and system-level resource planning [25,8,26].

This comprehensive review examines the integration of social determinants of health (SDOH) with artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches for healthcare prediction. We focus specifically on developments between 2020 and 2025, a period characterized by rapid innovation in both AI/ML methodologies and SDOH data utilization [44]. Our analysis emphasizes applied approaches that have demonstrated practical implementation potential rather than theoretical frameworks alone.

The review encompasses multiple healthcare domains including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health, and emergency medicine, reflecting the broad applicability of SDOH-enhanced prediction across clinical specialties [45]. While we acknowledge related work in genomics and precision medicine, these areas fall outside our primary focus on social determinants and are addressed only where directly relevant to SDOH integration.

This review addresses four central research questions:

1. How are SDOH data being integrated with AI/ML predictive models across different healthcare domains, and what data sources are being utilized?
2. What are the current approaches for extracting and representing SDOH in computational systems, particularly from unstructured clinical notes and community-level datasets?
3. How do SDOH-enhanced AI/ML models perform compared to traditional clinical models in terms of predictive accuracy, generalizability, and utility for addressing health disparities?
4. What ethical, technical, and implementation challenges exist in this field, and what strategies have been proposed to address them?

While some healthcare institutions have raised concerns about incorporating SDOH data into predictive models due to potential privacy implications and algorithmic bias, the potential benefits have led many others to adopt more accommodating approaches. As Chen et al. [46] observed, the number of health systems embracing these technologies is rising more quickly than those imposing restrictions. This trend reflects growing recognition that, much like technological innovations that preceded them, SDOH-enhanced AI tools represent an opportunity that, with proper integration and guidelines, can significantly enhance clinical decision-making rather than threaten equity.

This review builds upon and extends previous work in the field, particularly the systematic review by Chen et al. [46] on social determinants in predictive analytics. We differentiate our contribution in five significant ways:

First, we include the most recent developments (2020-2025), a period of significant advancement in both AI/ML capabilities and SDOH awareness characterized by the emergence of large language models and multimodal architectures. Second, we focus more deeply on AI/ML methodologies and their technical implementation, including emerging approaches like large language models for SDOH extraction and novel techniques for incorporating geospatial data. Third, we evaluate model performance across diverse patient populations and clinical settings, addressing critical questions of generalizability and transportability that have emerged as central concerns in recent literature. Fourth, we provide a comprehensive framework for ethical implementation that addresses bias, fairness, and health equity concerns, synthesizing emerging best practices from across the field. Fifth, we examine multimodal data integration approaches that combine structured, semi-structured, and unstructured SDOH information, reflecting the increasingly sophisticated data architectures being deployed in real-world implementations.

The remainder of this review is organized as follows: Section 2 details our methodological approach to literature identification and synthesis. Section 3 examines data sources and representation approaches for SDOH in AI/ML applications. Section 4 analyzes predictive modeling techniques and their performance across clinical domains. Section 5 addresses ethical considerations and implementation challenges. Section 6 discusses emerging trends and future research directions, while Section 7 provides concluding insights and recommendations.

This review contributes to the field by synthesizing current knowledge, identifying research gaps, and providing guidance for researchers, clinicians, and health system leaders seeking to implement SDOH-enhanced predictive models. Our target audience includes medical informatics researchers, data scientists, healthcare administrators, clinicians, and policymakers interested in leveraging AI/ML and SDOH data to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities. As the field continues to evolve rapidly, this comprehensive assessment provides a foundation for both understanding the current state of the art and charting promising directions for future research and implementation.
