# Social Determinants of Health and AI/ML for Predictive Modeling: A Comprehensive Review

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context and Background

Recent years have witnessed the profound integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across healthcare domains, from diagnostic assistance to treatment optimization and clinical prediction. AI has now permeated clinical workflows, transforming how healthcare providers approach patient care, risk assessment, and resource allocation (Davenport and Kalakota, 2019). The rapid advancement of computational technologies has enabled increasingly complex modeling approaches, with machine learning (ML) algorithms demonstrating remarkable capabilities in processing vast quantities of healthcare data (Rajkomar et al., 2019).

Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods represent a significant departure from traditional statistical approaches in healthcare analytics. While conventional methods primarily focused on retrospective analysis and required explicit rule definition, modern AI systems can autonomously identify patterns, adapt to new information, and generate predictive insights without continuous human supervision (Miotto et al., 2018). This evolution has enabled healthcare systems to transition from reactive care models to proactive strategies that anticipate patient needs, predict clinical deterioration, and optimize resource allocation across diverse patient populations.

The technical foundation of healthcare AI has evolved substantially, with deep learning frameworks demonstrating particularly promising results across numerous clinical applications. These sophisticated neural network architectures excel at identifying complex non-linear relationships within heterogeneous data sources, allowing for more nuanced understanding of patient risk factors and trajectories (Miotto et al., 2018). Natural Language Processing (NLP), a specialized branch of AI focused on human language interpretation, has emerged as a particularly valuable capability for healthcare systems, enabling automated extraction of clinically relevant information from unstructured documentation (Wang et al., 2018).

Despite the significant technological progress in healthcare AI, traditional clinical prediction models have been constrained by their limited capacity to incorporate non-clinical factors that profoundly influence health outcomes. This limitation has become increasingly apparent as healthcare systems recognize the critical role that social and environmental circumstances play in shaping patient trajectories. Social determinants of health (SDOH) have emerged as essential predictive variables that can significantly enhance the accuracy, generalizability, and practical utility of AI-driven healthcare models (Chen et al., 2020).

Social determinants of health encompass the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, including factors such as economic stability, educational access, physical environment, social context, and healthcare accessibility (World Health Organization, 2023). These factors exert profound influence on health outcomes through multiple mechanisms, including differential exposure to health risks, variable access to preventive services, disparate treatment efficacy, and uneven distribution of healthcare resources (Marmot, 2005). The recognition of SDOH's critical importance has prompted healthcare systems to develop more comprehensive frameworks for data collection, analysis, and intervention that extend beyond traditional clinical parameters (Gottlieb et al., 2015).

The integration of SDOH data with artificial intelligence has significantly expanded the capabilities of predictive healthcare systems. The resulting SDOH-enhanced models demonstrate several distinguishing characteristics compared to traditional clinical prediction approaches. First, these models incorporate diverse data sources beyond the electronic health record, including community-level information, geographic indicators, and social service utilization patterns. Second, they frequently employ more sophisticated computational architectures capable of processing heterogeneous inputs across varying timescales and granularities (Rashid et al., 2024). Third, these enhanced models often demonstrate superior generalizability across diverse patient populations, addressing a critical limitation of traditional models that frequently underperform when applied to socially disadvantaged groups (Segar et al., 2022).

The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have established comprehensive frameworks for categorizing SDOH domains, providing conceptual structure for data collection and analysis efforts (World Health Organization, 2008; Hacker et al., 2021). In the United States, the most widely adopted framework delineates five key domains:

1. **Economic Stability**: Encompasses employment status, income levels, financial resource adequacy, debt burden, and access to assistance programs (Chen et al., 2020; McNeill et al., 2023)
2. **Education Access and Quality**: Includes literacy rates, educational attainment, vocational training opportunities, and early childhood education quality (McNeill et al., 2023; Teshale et al., 2023)
3. **Healthcare Access and Quality**: Encompasses insurance coverage, provider availability, affordability of services, and quality of received care (Cantor and Thorpe, 2018; Hatef et al., 2019)
4. **Neighborhood and Built Environment**: Addresses housing quality and safety, transportation infrastructure, environmental exposures, food security, and recreational opportunities (Kihal-Talantikite et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020)
5. **Social and Community Context**: Includes social integration, support systems, community engagement, experiences of discrimination, and involvement with justice systems (Paradies et al., 2015; McNeill et al., 2023)

Recent technical innovations have significantly enhanced the accessibility and utility of SDOH information for clinical prediction systems. Particularly noteworthy is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) that can extract social determinant information from unstructured clinical documentation with unprecedented accuracy (Gu et al., 2025). These models can identify explicit mentions of housing instability, food insecurity, transportation barriers, and other social factors documented in clinical narratives, enabling automated structuring of previously inaccessible information. The extraction capabilities of these models represent a crucial advancement, as much of the most valuable SDOH information exists within free-text documentation rather than structured data fields (Scherbakov et al., 2025).

Beyond text-based approaches, multimodal AI architectures have expanded the scope of SDOH integration through incorporation of diverse data types. These advanced systems can synthesize information from clinical documentation, claims data, community-level indicators, geospatial information, and even non-traditional sources such as social media or mobile health applications (Rashid et al., 2024). This technical capacity for data synthesis enables more comprehensive patient profiles that capture both clinical and social vulnerability factors across multiple domains and levels of granularity. Notably, these systems can operate at varying scales—from individual-level risk prediction to population-level resource allocation planning—making them versatile tools for addressing health disparities at multiple intervention points.

### 1.2 Significance and Impact

Health disparities present one of the most persistent challenges in modern healthcare systems despite decades of intervention efforts. These disparities manifest across numerous dimensions, including mortality rates, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and healthcare utilization patterns. In the United States, comprehensive analyses of population health data reveal substantial life expectancy gaps between socioeconomic groups, with individuals in the lowest income quartile experiencing mortality rates significantly higher than those in higher-income brackets (Chetty et al., 2016). These disparities persist across racial and ethnic groups, geographic regions, and educational attainment levels even after controlling for clinical risk factors.

The economic consequences of health disparities are substantial, representing both a humanitarian concern and a significant financial burden on healthcare systems and broader economies. Recent economic analyses estimate that health disparities cost the U.S. healthcare system approximately $93 billion in excess medical care costs annually, with an additional $42 billion in lost productivity. As chronic disease prevalence continues to rise globally, these costs are projected to increase substantially, with estimates suggesting worldwide costs could reach $47 trillion by 2030 if current trends continue (Hacker, 2024).

The integration of SDOH data into AI-driven predictive models presents a promising approach for addressing these persistent health disparities more effectively than previous intervention efforts. Financial modeling indicates that addressing social determinants through targeted interventions could reduce healthcare expenditures by approximately 11%, representing substantial potential savings across healthcare systems (Whitman et al., 2022). This economic reality has catalyzed growing market interest in SDOH-enhanced technologies, with investment capital flowing rapidly into this sector. Recent projections from academic research indicate substantial growth in AI applications for healthcare, with increased focus on models that incorporate social determinants to improve prediction accuracy and address health disparities (Chen et al., 2020; Snowdon et al., 2023). This accelerated growth in research and implementation reflects widespread recognition of both the clinical and economic value propositions associated with SDOH-enhanced predictive systems.

The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the critical relationship between social determinants and health outcomes, serving as a profound real-world demonstration of how social vulnerability translates into clinical risk. Population-level analyses conducted during the pandemic revealed that communities with adverse social determinant profiles experienced significantly higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality compared to more advantaged areas (Bambra et al., 2020). These stark outcome differences persisted even after controlling for clinical comorbidities, with multiple studies suggesting that approximately 60% of outcome variation could be attributed to social rather than strictly medical factors. This highly visible manifestation of health inequity has accelerated both public and private sector interest in leveraging AI/ML approaches that incorporate social determinants for more effective public health response planning and resource allocation.

Adoption patterns of SDOH-enhanced AI systems across medical specialties demonstrate the growing recognition of these tools' clinical value. Early implementation has been particularly prominent in certain domains, with cardiovascular medicine serving as an instructive case study. In this field, models incorporating neighborhood disadvantage indices, food access metrics, and transportation barriers have demonstrated significant improvements in predicting adverse outcomes compared to traditional risk calculators based solely on clinical parameters (McNeill et al., 2023). These enhanced models have shown particular value for patient populations traditionally underserved by conventional risk stratification approaches, including racial and ethnic minorities and individuals with limited English proficiency.

Emergency medicine represents another domain with substantial SDOH-AI adoption, where predictive models have demonstrated particular utility in identifying patients at risk for frequent emergency department utilization, hospital readmission, and adverse post-discharge outcomes (Abbott et al., 2024). These models enable more effective resource allocation and targeted interventions for high-risk individuals, potentially reducing unnecessary utilization while improving outcomes for vulnerable patients. Beyond these early-adopting specialties, SDOH-enhanced prediction tools are increasingly penetrating diverse clinical domains, including primary care, mental health services, pediatrics, and even surgical specialties traditionally more resistant to predictive model adoption.

The technical performance of SDOH-enhanced prediction models provides compelling evidence for their clinical utility. Systematic evaluation of model performance across diverse implementation contexts demonstrates consistent improvements in predictive accuracy when social determinant factors are incorporated alongside traditional clinical variables. SDOH-enhanced models typically demonstrate AUC improvements ranging from 0.03 to 0.15 compared to clinical-only models (Segar et al., 2022). Beyond these general performance improvements, SDOH-enhanced models frequently demonstrate particularly pronounced accuracy gains for traditionally underrepresented patient groups, helping to address a critical limitation of conventional models that often perform poorly for marginalized populations.

The specific mechanisms through which SDOH-enhanced models improve prediction typically involve more nuanced risk stratification within clinically similar patient groups. By incorporating factors such as neighborhood characteristics, social support availability, and economic circumstances, these models can differentiate between patients who appear clinically similar but face substantially different environmental challenges that influence their health trajectories (Chen et al., 2020). This capacity for more granular risk assessment enables more precise targeting of interventions, more efficient resource allocation, and ultimately more equitable healthcare delivery across diverse patient populations.

Cross-sector partnerships have emerged as a critical enabler of this field's growth, with collaboration between healthcare delivery organizations, technology developers, community-based organizations, and academic institutions becoming increasingly common. These collaborative arrangements facilitate the development of more holistic approaches to both data collection and intervention design (Gottlieb et al., 2016; DeSalvo et al., 2016). Federal research funding has similarly expanded to support these efforts, with the National Institutes of Health and other agencies allocating substantial resources to SDOH-related research initiatives in recent funding cycles (Barragan, 2021).

### 1.3 Healthcare System Context

Contemporary healthcare delivery occurs within increasingly complex sociotechnical systems characterized by growing digital capabilities but persistent structural challenges. While other industries have rapidly transformed their operations through digital technologies, healthcare has historically adopted technological innovations more cautiously due to regulatory constraints, privacy concerns, implementation complexities, and change management challenges (Matheny et al., 2019; Char et al., 2018). Despite these challenges, healthcare systems globally are now undergoing significant digital transformation, with artificial intelligence and machine learning increasingly embedded within clinical workflows, administrative processes, and decision support systems (Davenport and Kalakota, 2019; Maddox et al., 2019).

The economic dimensions of healthcare's digital transformation are substantial, with the healthcare AI sector experiencing rapid expansion driven by increasing adoption across clinical and operational domains (Shah et al., 2024; Ong et al., 2024). This growth encompasses diverse applications including diagnostic support systems, administrative automation tools, patient monitoring technologies, and the predictive analytics platforms that form the focus of this review (Rajkomar et al., 2019; Miotto et al., 2018). Bibliometric analysis of research output in this domain reveals significant multidisciplinary contributions, with computer science, medicine, engineering, and mathematics collectively accounting for more than two-thirds of academic publications (Miotto et al., 2018; Rashid et al., 2024). The field of medical informatics has emerged as a particularly valuable contributor, often serving as the crucial translational bridge between technical innovation and clinical implementation (Wang et al., 2018; Abbott et al., 2024).

Within clinical prediction specifically, traditional approaches have historically emphasized physiological parameters, laboratory values, and diagnostic codes while largely excluding social and environmental factors (Goldstein et al., 2017). These conventional models typically rely on well-established statistical methods applied to structured medical data, generating risk scores that clinicians can easily interpret and incorporate into decision-making processes (Goldstein et al., 2017). While such approaches have demonstrated utility in specific contexts—particularly for conditions with strong physiological determinants—they frequently demonstrate limited performance when applied across heterogeneous populations or when predicting outcomes strongly influenced by non-clinical factors (Chen et al., 2020).

The limitations of clinical-only predictive models become particularly apparent when examining their performance across diverse patient populations. Models developed using predominantly homogeneous patient cohorts often exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to different demographic groups or care settings (Maddox et al., 2019). This generalizability challenge stems primarily from the models' inability to capture critical contextual factors that moderate health risks and outcomes. As researchers in this domain have observed, "efforts to address health disparities have been hindered by lack of knowledge about how social determinants compound problems of access and treatment, as well as ways in which these factors may be practically addressed" (Chen et al., 2020).

Despite growing recognition of social determinants' importance, healthcare systems face significant implementation barriers when attempting to integrate this information into clinical workflows and predictive models. Documentation practices represent a fundamental challenge, with substantial inconsistency in how SDOH factors are recorded across institutions, providers, and information systems (Hatef et al., 2019). While many healthcare organizations claim to collect social determinant information, they employ widely divergent approaches, terminologies, and assessment frameworks, creating significant challenges for data aggregation and cross-system analysis (Cantor and Thorpe, 2018). Even when examining specific social factors such as housing instability—widely recognized as clinically relevant—the operational definitions and documentation standards vary considerably, complicating efforts to develop generalizable prediction models (Lewis et al., 2020).

Data fragmentation presents another substantial barrier to SDOH integration, as relevant information typically exists across multiple disconnected systems with limited interoperability. Social determinant data may be distributed across electronic health records, claims databases, public health registries, social service systems, and census datasets, each using different identifiers, structures, and access protocols (Gottlieb et al., 2016). This distribution creates significant technical challenges for data aggregation and linkage, requiring sophisticated identity resolution mechanisms and data harmonization approaches that many healthcare organizations lack (DeSalvo et al., 2016). Temporal misalignment further complicates integration efforts, as social determinant information often changes more rapidly than clinical data collection cycles can capture (Hatef et al., 2019).

The absence of standardized terminologies specifically designed for social determinant documentation represents an additional fundamental challenge. While clinical information benefits from robust standardization frameworks such as ICD-10, LOINC, RxNorm, and SNOMED CT, comparable terminologies for social factors remain underdeveloped or inconsistently implemented (Cantor and Thorpe, 2018). This standardization gap manifests in multiple ways, including variable definitions of key constructs (e.g., what constitutes "food insecurity"), inconsistent measurement approaches, and incompatible coding systems across institutions (Hatef et al., 2019).

Existing health information technology infrastructure presents additional implementation challenges, as electronic health record systems were not fundamentally designed to accommodate social determinant data (DeSalvo et al., 2016). Most commercial EHR platforms were developed primarily to support clinical documentation and billing processes, with social factor documentation capabilities added as secondary features rather than core functionalities (Cantor and Thorpe, 2018). Consequently, these systems often lack appropriate structured fields, screening workflows, visualization capabilities, and integration pathways necessary for systematic SDOH documentation and utilization (Cantor and Thorpe, 2018).

Provider-level barriers further complicate integration efforts, as clinicians typically face numerous competing demands within time-constrained encounters. Many providers report insufficient time, inadequate training, uncertainty about appropriate interventions, and absence of reimbursement as significant obstacles to comprehensive SDOH assessment (Lewis et al., 2020). These constraints contribute to substantial inconsistency in documentation practices, with some studies indicating that over 80% of potentially relevant social information identified through research protocols remains uncaptured in routine clinical documentation (Hatef et al., 2019).

When social determinant information is documented within healthcare systems, it frequently appears in unstructured clinical narratives rather than structured data fields more readily accessible to analytical systems (Hatef et al., 2019). This documentation pattern creates significant extraction challenges that require sophisticated natural language processing capabilities many organizations lack (Wang et al., 2018). Even when structured fields exist, they often capture simplified representations of complex social phenomena, potentially obscuring important nuances relevant to clinical prediction (Lewis et al., 2020).

Ethical considerations present perhaps the most profound challenge when incorporating social determinants into clinical prediction models. Without careful implementation, SDOH-enhanced prediction systems risk perpetuating or even amplifying existing health disparities through several mechanisms (Char et al., 2018). The inclusion of variables correlated with race or socioeconomic status without appropriate safeguards may create "algorithmic redlining" effects, whereby predictive systems inadvertently direct resources away from historically marginalized communities that would benefit most from intervention (Rajkomar et al., 2018). Additionally, poorly designed implementation approaches may reinforce stereotypes, stigmatize vulnerable patients, or create deterministic expectations about patient behaviors based on social categories (Rajkomar et al., 2018).

### 1.4 Research Scope and Objectives

Despite the substantial challenges outlined above, the integration of social determinants with artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches offers transformative potential for healthcare prediction and intervention planning. Recent empirical work across multiple domains demonstrates several distinct advantages of SDOH-enhanced prediction systems compared to conventional clinical models (Chen et al., 2020). For example, cardiovascular risk models incorporating neighborhood-level food access metrics and transportation barriers demonstrate significantly improved discrimination across diverse patient populations, with particularly pronounced performance gains for historically underserved groups (McNeill et al., 2023).

The technological foundation for SDOH integration has strengthened considerably in recent years. Large language models can now extract social determinant information from unstructured clinical documentation with unprecedented accuracy, enabling scalable access to previously inaccessible social context data (Gu et al., 2025). In emergency medicine specifically, SDOH-AI integration enables more effective identification of patients at risk for adverse post-discharge outcomes, supporting more targeted allocation of care management resources (Abbott et al., 2024). Multimodal data integration approaches further extend these capabilities, enabling simultaneous incorporation of structured clinical data, unstructured documentation, community-level indicators, and even non-traditional data sources like environmental monitoring systems (Rashid et al., 2024).

SDOH-enhanced prediction systems offer four key capabilities that distinguish them from traditional clinical models. First, they demonstrate superior generalizability across diverse patient populations through incorporation of factors that mediate health outcomes across different demographic and social groups (Chen et al., 2020). Second, they enable more granular risk stratification by identifying socially vulnerable patients within clinically similar cohorts, facilitating more precise intervention targeting (Segar et al., 2022). Third, they support advanced population health management by generating insights about community-level risk patterns and resource allocation priorities (Chen et al., 2020). Fourth, they explicitly address health equity by accounting for social factors that contribute to disparities, providing quantitative support for resource allocation decisions that prioritize vulnerable populations (Chen et al., 2020).

In clinical workflows specifically, SDOH-enhanced prediction systems serve multiple complementary functions that extend beyond traditional risk calculators. As risk identification tools, these systems can automatically flag patients with elevated vulnerability across various outcome domains, enabling proactive intervention before adverse events occur (Abbott et al., 2024). As resource allocation guides, they support more precise targeting of limited healthcare resources such as care management services, home-based interventions, and community health worker programs (Segar et al., 2022). Many implementations also function as decision support mechanisms, providing clinicians with contextualized suggestions for referrals, follow-up intensity, and care plan development (Abbott et al., 2024).

This comprehensive review examines the integration of social determinants of health with artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches for healthcare prediction. We focus specifically on developments between 2020 and 2025, a period characterized by rapid innovation in both computational methodologies and SDOH data utilization (Rashid et al., 2024). Our analysis emphasizes applied approaches with demonstrated implementation feasibility rather than purely theoretical frameworks, addressing four central research questions:

1. How are social determinant data being integrated with AI/ML predictive models across different healthcare domains, and what specific data sources are being utilized?
2. What methodological approaches have been developed for extracting and representing SDOH information in computational systems, particularly from unstructured clinical documentation and community-level datasets?
3. How do SDOH-enhanced AI/ML models perform compared to traditional clinical models in terms of predictive accuracy, generalizability, and clinical utility across diverse patient populations?
4. What ethical, technical, and implementation challenges exist in this field, and what strategies have been proposed to address them effectively?

This review builds upon and extends previous work in the field, particularly the systematic review by Chen and colleagues (2020) examining social determinants in healthcare predictive analytics. We differentiate our contribution through several key dimensions. First, we incorporate the substantial body of research published between 2020 and 2025, a period of unprecedented acceleration in both AI capabilities and SDOH awareness (Rashid et al., 2024). Second, we provide more detailed technical analysis of emerging methodological approaches, including large language models, multimodal architectures, and explainable AI techniques specifically applied to SDOH-enhanced prediction (Gu et al., 2025; Rashid et al., 2024). Third, we evaluate model performance across diverse patient populations and clinical settings, with particular emphasis on generalizability and equity considerations (Segar et al., 2022). Fourth, we develop a comprehensive framework for ethical implementation that addresses bias, fairness, and health equity throughout the AI development lifecycle (Rajkomar et al., 2018).

The remainder of this review is structured as follows: Section 2 details our methodological approach to literature identification, selection, and synthesis. Section 3 examines data sources and representation approaches for integrating social determinants into predictive healthcare models. Section 4 analyzes computational techniques and architectures employed across diverse clinical applications. Section 5 evaluates the evidence for predictive performance and clinical utility across implementation contexts. Section 6 addresses ethical considerations, implementation challenges, and proposed solutions. Finally, Section 7 discusses emerging trends, research gaps, and future directions for the field.

This review contributes to the field by synthesizing current knowledge, identifying promising approaches, highlighting persistent challenges, and providing a structured framework for researchers, clinicians, and health system leaders seeking to implement SDOH-enhanced predictive models responsibly. Our target audience includes medical informatics researchers, data scientists, healthcare administrators, clinicians, public health officials, and policymakers interested in leveraging SDOH data and AI/ML techniques to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities.
