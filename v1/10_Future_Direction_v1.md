# 10. Future Directions

The rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence applications for social determinants of health presents numerous opportunities for technical advancement, implementation refinement, and health system transformation. As this systematic review has demonstrated, significant progress has been made in developing and validating predictive models that incorporate social determinants of health. However, important knowledge gaps remain that require focused research attention. 

This section systematically examines the future of SDOH-AI integration through multiple complementary perspectives. First, we identify critical unresolved questions that have emerged from the limitations in current approaches, highlighting areas where fundamental conceptual and methodological challenges persist. Second, we propose targeted methodological advances specifically designed to overcome documented technical limitations in existing systems. Third, we prioritize research directions based on their theoretical significance and practical potential to improve health outcomes for vulnerable populations. Fourth, we bridge theoretical developments with implementation considerations, recognizing that even the most sophisticated models will have limited impact without effective translation into practice. Finally, we contextualize emerging technological and policy trends that could substantially reshape this field's trajectory in coming years. By articulating this comprehensive research agenda, we aim to guide future scholarly efforts toward the most promising and impactful directions for SDOH-AI integration.

## 10.1 Technical Advances

### 10.1.1 Emerging Approaches

Recent technological innovations are expanding the capabilities of SDOH-AI integration in several promising directions, addressing key limitations identified throughout this review. One particularly significant development is **federated learning for privacy-preserving SDOH prediction**. As noted by Freij et al. (2019), privacy concerns represent a significant barrier to SDOH data integration across systems. Federated learning approaches enable model development across distributed datasets without sharing sensitive individual-level information, potentially addressing this constraint. These approaches are particularly valuable for combining SDOH data across healthcare, social service, housing, education, and other sectors that each hold valuable but sensitive information. The technical challenge of training robust models while maintaining privacy guarantees represents a critical research frontier that could dramatically expand data availability for SDOH research.

**Self-supervised learning for SDOH representation** represents another promising innovation addressing the scarcity of labeled SDOH data. Yang et al. (2025) demonstrated how representation learning techniques can capture complex relationships between social determinants in unstructured clinical text without requiring extensive manual annotation. Their hierarchical attention transformer architecture effectively captured both local contextual information and global temporal patterns of social risk factors, achieving F1 scores of 0.87-0.93 compared to traditional NLP approaches (0.62-0.78). These advances enable more nuanced understanding of how different social factors interact and evolve over time, potentially unlocking valuable information in existing unlabeled datasets.

**Explainable AI approaches for SDOH factors** continue to gain prominence as implementation expands beyond research contexts. Lundberg et al. (2018) demonstrated how SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide interpretable predictions by calculating the contribution of each input variable, enabling clinicians to understand which social factors most strongly influence predicted outcomes for individual patients. These techniques are evolving beyond simple feature importance rankings to provide contextual explanations that account for interactions between social and clinical factors, addressing the "black box" problem that has limited adoption of complex models in clinical practice. This technical approach aligns with growing ethical and regulatory requirements for transparency in healthcare AI applications (Char et al., 2018).

The **integration of SDOH with genomics and other omics data** represents a frontier with transformative potential for understanding complex disease mechanisms. Emerging research is beginning to explore how social and biological determinants interact through epigenetic modifications, inflammatory pathways, and other biological mechanisms. This integration addresses a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of how social factors "get under the skin" to influence health outcomes. Multimodal models that incorporate these diverse data types could substantially deepen our understanding of health disparities and enable more precise interventions that address both biological and social factors (Simon et al., 2024).

Recent work has also seen significant advances in **multimodal representation learning**, which combines different types of SDOH data including structured assessments, unstructured clinical notes, geospatial information, and digital biomarkers. Moukheiber et al. (2024) presented a framework for extracting and fusing satellite imagery with public health data to generate multimodal risk maps incorporating both environmental variables and traditional health indicators. Similarly, Cai et al. (2024) introduced a contrastive learning approach for electronic health record analysis that jointly learns representations from structured and unstructured data, demonstrating performance improvements of up to 2.0% in AUC across various prediction tasks.

Cross-attention mechanisms within these multimodal architectures facilitate analysis of relationships between clinical and social domains, identifying how medical conditions may affect or be affected by social circumstances (Simon et al., 2024). These technical capabilities support more comprehensive health risk assessment with enhanced geospatial validation capabilities for both predictive modeling and intervention planning. Future research should focus on developing specialized attention mechanisms that can effectively model the complex interdependencies between social determinants and clinical factors across different temporal scales.

### 10.1.2 Interoperability Innovations

Significant challenges in SDOH data interoperability persist, limiting the potential for seamless integration across health and social care systems. Golembiewski et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review of SDOH data interoperability and identified several promising developments in **FHIR-based SDOH standards**. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) has developed specific resources for social determinants documentation, enabling standardized exchange of SDOH information between systems. However, their review found that only 38% of implementations used FHIR standards, highlighting substantial opportunity for further standardization. Key research priorities include developing SDOH-specific FHIR profiles that balance comprehensiveness with implementation feasibility across diverse clinical and community settings.

**Common data models for SDOH integration** represent another active area of development. Recent efforts have focused on creating standardized frameworks for representing diverse SDOH factors within existing health data infrastructure. These initiatives aim to address inconsistent data models across systems, which Golembiewski et al. (2022) identified as a barrier in 71% of SDOH data integration implementations. Standardization efforts include both structural representation (how data is organized and related) and semantic interoperability (ensuring consistent meaning and interpretation across systems). Future research should focus on harmonizing existing data models and developing validation methodologies to ensure that standardized models adequately capture the contextual nuances of social determinants across diverse populations.

The development of **open-source data harmonization tools** has accelerated in recent years, with several platforms emerging to support SDOH data standardization and integration. These tools facilitate mapping between different coding systems, translating between proprietary and standard formats, and consolidating SDOH data from diverse sources. By reducing technical barriers to integration, these tools enable broader implementation of SDOH-enhanced prediction models across different healthcare contexts. However, significant challenges remain in scalability and usability that must be addressed through user-centered design approaches and robust validation studies.

Several health information technology standards have emerged to address SDOH data fragmentation. Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) provides standardized codes for SDOH assessment instruments and questions, facilitating consistent representation of screening results. SNOMED Clinical Terms offers detailed terminology for coding specific social circumstances, though implementation of these codes varies substantially across organizations (Arons et al., 2019). Future research should focus on developing comprehensive crosswalks between different terminology systems and quantifying the information loss that occurs during standardization processes.

While progress has been made in SDOH data standardization, Golembiewski et al. (2022) found significant gaps in representing SDOH interventions and referrals, with only 13 and 10 codes respectively identified across all vocabularies. This limited standardization hampers interoperability for tracking social service referrals and outcomes, an essential component of comprehensive SDOH-AI integration. A promising research direction involves developing standardized terminologies and data models specifically for social interventions and outcomes, enabling closed-loop tracking of referrals and intervention effectiveness across sectors. Such standards would significantly advance the field's ability to evaluate and optimize SDOH interventions at both individual and population levels.

## 10.2 Implementation Science

### 10.2.1 Implementation Frameworks

As SDOH-AI applications move from research to practice, implementation science frameworks provide essential guidance for effective integration into clinical workflows and community contexts. This transition represents a critical knowledge gap, as even the most accurate and equitable models will have limited impact if they cannot be effectively deployed in real-world settings. Buitron de la Vega et al. (2019) demonstrated the feasibility of implementing an electronic health record-based social determinants screening and referral system in primary care settings. Their implementation model emphasized the importance of codesigning screening questions and referral workflows with providers and staff, integrating the system into existing workflows, and providing ongoing technical assistance. Their findings highlight the value of iterative, stakeholder-driven design processes in overcoming implementation barriers.

Gold et al. (2022) expanded on these findings in their study of SDOH EHR tool adoption in community health centers, identifying factors that influence successful integration. Their research highlighted several critical elements for effective implementation, including having leadership champions for SDOH strategies, prior collection of social information, adequate resources for staff, and participation in practice transformation initiatives. Future implementation research should explore how these factors interact in different organizational contexts and develop targeted strategies to address specific adoption barriers.

The Contextual Adoption of Predictive Systems (CAPS) model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding implementation success and failure patterns, explicitly incorporating organizational, environmental, and algorithmic factors (Hahn-Goldberg et al., 2024). This model advances implementation science by recognizing the unique challenges of predictive AI systems compared to other health innovations. Research priorities include validating the CAPS model across diverse healthcare settings and developing implementation readiness assessment tools based on its key constructs.

**Models for stakeholder engagement** have evolved to recognize the diverse perspectives needed for successful SDOH-AI implementation. Effective approaches leverage cross-sector governance structures (identified as a facilitator in 74% of successful implementations by Golembiewski et al., 2022) and user-centered design principles (a facilitator in 62% of implementations). These approaches acknowledge that SDOH-AI integration requires collaboration across healthcare, social services, community organizations, and patient advocates. Future research should develop and validate standardized frameworks for stakeholder identification and engagement specifically tailored to SDOH-AI implementation, with particular attention to incorporating perspectives from historically marginalized communities.

**Evaluation methodologies for SDOH-AI implementations** continue to advance beyond simple adoption metrics to more comprehensive assessment frameworks. Li et al. (2024) evaluated the implementation of an SDOH screening and referral program in emergency medicine using both process measures (screening rates, identified needs, referral acceptance) and outcome measures (reductions in avoidable ED visits and all-cause utilization). Such multidimensional evaluation approaches provide more nuanced understanding of implementation effectiveness. Research priorities include developing standardized implementation outcome measures specific to SDOH-AI, enabling meaningful comparisons across different implementation contexts and strategies.

Innovative evaluation approaches include assessing both implementation outcomes (adoption, fidelity, penetration) and clinical outcomes, with increasing emphasis on health equity impacts. Hahn-Goldberg et al. (2024) found that implementation effectiveness varied significantly by implementation strategy, highlighting the importance of tailored approaches based on organizational context and population needs. Future research should develop methods for prospectively matching implementation strategies to organizational characteristics, potentially using predictive models to identify the optimal approach for a given setting.

The most successful implementation models emphasize incremental integration, starting with focused applications that demonstrate clear value before expanding scope. This approach builds organizational buy-in, develops implementation expertise, and enables iterative refinement based on early experiences. Technical integration with existing EHR systems remains a critical success factor, with automated integration significantly outperforming manual or parallel documentation processes (Hahn-Goldberg et al., 2024). A key research priority is developing and validating implementation roadmaps that guide organizations through this incremental approach, with clear milestones and decision points for expanding scope.

### 10.2.2 Educational Needs

The successful implementation of SDOH-AI solutions depends critically on workforce readiness across multiple roles, representing a significant knowledge gap in current approaches. **Clinician training requirements** encompass both technical literacy and workflow adaptation. Healthcare providers need foundational understanding of how SDOH factors influence health outcomes, how prediction models incorporate this information, and how to effectively interpret and act on model outputs. Implementation studies consistently identify inadequate training as a significant barrier to adoption (Gold et al., 2022). Future research should develop and evaluate standardized curricula for different clinical roles and practice settings, identifying the optimal timing, format, and content of training programs to maximize effectiveness while minimizing burden on busy clinicians.

Effective clinician education models include both didactic training on SDOH concepts and hands-on practice with specific tools and workflows. Simulation-based training has demonstrated particular effectiveness for helping providers practice integrating SDOH screening and intervention into time-constrained clinical encounters. Continuing education on evolving SDOH-AI applications ensures that healthcare teams maintain current knowledge as capabilities advance. Research priorities include developing and validating competency frameworks specific to SDOH-AI implementation, enabling standardized assessment of workforce readiness across different organizations and roles.

**Data science workforce development** represents another critical educational need. The growing complexity of SDOH-AI applications requires specialized expertise in data integration, model development, validation, and implementation. Current workforce pipelines inadequately address the need for professionals with both technical expertise and healthcare domain knowledge. Interdisciplinary educational programs that combine data science, public health, and clinical perspectives can help address this gap. Future research should identify core competencies for this specialized workforce, develop academic and professional training programs to meet these needs, and evaluate the impact of different educational approaches on workforce capabilities and career outcomes.

**Patient and community education approaches** constitute the third essential educational domain. Thompson et al. (2024) found that patients were significantly more likely to disclose social needs when screening was presented as directly relevant to their treatment plan rather than for general documentation purposes. Effective patient education clarifies the purpose of SDOH assessment, how information will be used, and available resources for addressing identified needs. Research priorities include developing and testing educational materials and approaches for different patient populations, with particular attention to health literacy, cultural appropriateness, and potential stigma associated with social needs.

Community education extends beyond individual patients to engage broader populations in understanding and shaping SDOH-AI applications. Participatory approaches that involve community members in design, implementation, and evaluation help ensure that these technologies address locally relevant priorities and respect community values. Educational initiatives can empower communities to advocate for responsible use of these technologies and equitable distribution of benefits. Future research should develop and evaluate models for sustained community engagement throughout the SDOH-AI development lifecycle, identifying effective strategies for meaningful participation that avoids tokenism while respecting community members' time and expertise.

A particularly promising research direction involves developing educational interventions that simultaneously address multiple stakeholder groups, building shared understanding and collaborative approaches to SDOH-AI implementation. Such integrated educational programs could foster cross-disciplinary communication, align expectations across stakeholder groups, and build collective capacity for effective implementation. Research priorities include developing and testing these integrated educational approaches in diverse healthcare and community settings.

## 10.3 Policy and System-Level Changes

### 10.3.1 Policy Considerations

The policy environment strongly influences both the development and implementation of SDOH-enhanced AI/ML applications. Critical knowledge gaps exist regarding optimal policy approaches that simultaneously promote innovation, protect privacy, ensure equity, and support sustainable implementation. **Regulatory frameworks for SDOH data** must balance promoting beneficial uses with protecting privacy and preventing misuse. Freij et al. (2019) identified privacy concerns as a significant barrier to SDOH data integration, highlighting the need for clearer guidelines on appropriate collection, sharing, and use of social information. 

Golembiewski et al. (2022) found that inconsistent privacy regulations across sectors complicate SDOH data integration, with healthcare data governed by HIPAA while social service data may fall under different regulatory frameworks depending on the domain and funding source. Policy harmonization across these domains could facilitate more seamless integration while maintaining appropriate protections. Future policy research should develop and evaluate models for cross-sector data governance that balance privacy protection with data accessibility for beneficial uses, potentially through innovative approaches such as data trusts and federated access models.

**Payment models supporting SDOH intervention** represent another critical policy domain. Hacker (2024) noted that sophisticated algorithms for identifying high-risk individuals have been developed without corresponding payment mechanisms to support interventions for identified patients. This misalignment creates implementation barriers, as healthcare organizations may hesitate to invest in SDOH-AI capabilities without clear financial sustainability. Research priorities include developing and evaluating payment approaches that align financial incentives with SDOH-AI implementation, potentially through value-based payment arrangements that recognize the contribution of social interventions to improved outcomes and reduced costs.

Value-based payment models that incorporate social risk adjustment provide one potential approach for aligning financial incentives with SDOH-AI implementation. Such models acknowledge the additional resources required to address social needs and prevent adverse outcomes for socially vulnerable populations. Policy developments in this area include Medicare Advantage's expansion of supplemental benefits for social needs and state Medicaid initiatives for social risk adjustment. Future research should evaluate the impact of these emerging payment models on SDOH-AI adoption and implementation, identifying optimal approaches for different healthcare contexts and patient populations.

**Algorithmic fairness and accountability policies** constitute a third essential policy domain. Obermeyer et al. (2019) demonstrated how algorithmic bias in a widely-used healthcare algorithm resulted in significant racial disparities in care allocation, highlighting the importance of careful algorithm design and evaluation. Transparent reporting requirements for model performance across demographic groups can help identify and address such biases before implementation. Research priorities include developing and validating standardized fairness metrics specific to SDOH-AI applications, creating reporting frameworks that enable meaningful comparison across different models and use cases, and evaluating the impact of various policy approaches on model development practices and equity outcomes.

The policy landscape increasingly includes consideration of these ethical dimensions, with various frameworks emerging for responsible AI development in healthcare. These frameworks typically emphasize principles including fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and benefit maximization. Translation of these principles into specific regulatory requirements and standards continues to evolve as the field advances. Future research should evaluate how these emerging frameworks influence SDOH-AI development and implementation, identifying effective approaches for balancing innovation with appropriate safeguards. Particular attention should be paid to policies that address potential unintended consequences of SDOH-AI applications, such as reinforcement of existing biases or exacerbation of health disparities.

### 10.3.2 Healthcare System Transformation

SDOH-AI integration occurs within broader healthcare system transformation efforts, with significant implications for care delivery models and organizational structures. A critical knowledge gap exists regarding how to effectively incorporate SDOH-AI within different healthcare delivery models and system configurations. **Integration with value-based care models** represents a particularly promising approach, as these payment models reward improved outcomes and reduced costs rather than service volume. Davis et al. (2024) evaluated an SDOH-enhanced care management allocation framework within an accountable care organization, finding that patients assigned to care management based on the enhanced model showed a 17% greater reduction in hospitalization rates compared to allocation using traditional clinical risk scores, despite identical resource expenditure. Future research should evaluate different approaches for incorporating SDOH-AI within various value-based care models, identifying optimal configurations for different patient populations and healthcare contexts.

The economic dimensions of healthcare's digital transformation are substantial, with the healthcare AI sector experiencing rapid expansion driven by increasing adoption across clinical and operational domains. Ong et al. (2024) found that the healthcare AI sector specifically experienced 39.4% compound annual growth rate between 2020-2024, reflecting substantial investment in these capabilities. Research priorities include developing and validating economic models that quantify the return on investment for SDOH-AI implementation across different use cases and organizational contexts, enabling more informed investment decisions and sustainability planning.

**Cross-sector collaboration frameworks** are emerging to address the inherent limitations of healthcare-only approaches to social determinants. Fichtenberg et al. (2020) examined models for health and human services integration, identifying promising approaches for sustainable partnerships across sectors. These collaborative models establish governance structures, data sharing agreements, shared outcome metrics, and coordinated intervention pathways to address social needs more comprehensively. Future research should develop and validate frameworks for measuring cross-sector collaboration effectiveness specifically in the context of SDOH-AI implementation, identifying key success factors and barriers to sustainable partnerships.

**Community engagement models** represent a third essential component of healthcare system transformation. Traditional approaches to SDOH often reflect healthcare system priorities rather than community perspectives on social circumstances (Thompson et al., 2024). Patient-centered SDOH conceptualization enhances both the ethical foundations and practical relevance of SDOH-AI models. Research priorities include developing and evaluating methodologies for meaningful community engagement throughout the SDOH-AI development and implementation process, with particular attention to engagement approaches that address power imbalances and center the experiences of individuals from marginalized communities.

Emerging community engagement approaches emphasize bidirectional partnerships rather than extraction of community data or imposition of externally developed solutions. These models involve community members in problem definition, solution design, implementation planning, and outcome evaluation. Such approaches acknowledge the expertise of those with lived experience of social challenges and ensure that SDOH-AI applications address community-identified priorities. Future research should evaluate the impact of different community engagement models on SDOH-AI implementation outcomes, identifying approaches that simultaneously improve technical quality, implementation effectiveness, and health equity.

A particularly promising research direction involves investigating how these different system transformation approaches—value-based care integration, cross-sector collaboration, and community engagement—interact with and reinforce each other when implemented together. Developing comprehensive frameworks that integrate these complementary approaches could accelerate system transformation while ensuring that SDOH-AI applications achieve their full potential for improving health outcomes and reducing disparities.

## 10.4 Research Agenda

### 10.4.1 Near-term Research Priorities

Several research priorities warrant immediate attention to advance SDOH-AI integration, addressing critical knowledge gaps that currently limit the field's impact. **Validation studies across diverse populations** are essential to ensure that models developed in specific contexts generalize appropriately to different demographic groups and healthcare settings. Rajkomar et al. (2018) highlighted the importance of evaluating model performance across subgroups to identify and address potential disparities in predictive accuracy. Research in this area should systematically evaluate how model performance varies across demographic groups, geographic regions, and healthcare settings, developing standardized methodologies for assessing and reporting model generalizability.

Various methodological approaches have been developed to assess geographic generalizability, including leave-one-region-out validation, which iteratively evaluates models on geographic regions excluded from training; geographic calibration assessment, which examines probability calibration separately across regions; and geospatial error analysis, which visualizes performance patterns across geographic space to identify potential systematic biases (Weeks et al., 2023). Future research should refine and standardize these approaches, developing best practices for validating SDOH-AI models across different geographic contexts.

The statistical challenges of subgroup analysis—including reduced sample sizes, multiple comparison concerns, and potential for spurious findings—necessitate careful methodological approaches, with recent work exploring Bayesian hierarchical methods, adjustment for multiple testing, and minimum sample size thresholds for reliable subgroup assessment (Parikh et al., 2024). Research priorities include developing robust statistical frameworks specifically for evaluating SDOH-AI performance across demographic subgroups, balancing rigorous methodology with practical applicability in diverse healthcare settings.

**Implementation and usability studies** represent a second near-term research priority. Li et al. (2024) demonstrated the feasibility and impact of implementing an SDOH screening and referral program in emergency medicine, showing significant reductions in avoidable ED visits through targeted interventions. Similar research is needed across diverse clinical contexts to identify implementation factors that influence adoption, utilization, and impact of SDOH-AI applications. Research priorities include developing and validating standardized implementation outcome measures specific to SDOH-AI, enabling meaningful comparisons across different implementation approaches and contexts.

Usability research specifically focused on SDOH-AI interfaces and workflows is particularly needed, as these applications often involve complex information display and decision support requirements. Future studies should evaluate different approaches for presenting SDOH information and model outputs to clinicians, identifying design principles that optimize usability while supporting effective clinical decision-making. Particular attention should be paid to workflow integration within time-constrained clinical encounters, addressing a critical barrier to adoption identified in multiple implementation studies.

**Cost-effectiveness research** constitutes a third essential near-term priority. While mounting evidence demonstrates the predictive value of SDOH-enhanced models, fewer studies have rigorously evaluated the economic implications of implementation. Navathe et al. (2023) provided initial evidence that SDOH-informed predictive models can improve resource allocation efficiency in care management programs for older adults with cardiovascular disease. Additional research is needed to quantify return on investment across different use cases, implementation approaches, and healthcare contexts. Future studies should develop standardized methodologies for economic evaluation of SDOH-AI implementations, considering both direct implementation costs and downstream impacts on healthcare utilization and outcomes.

Addressing these near-term priorities will provide essential evidence to guide implementation decisions and policy development. By demonstrating both clinical effectiveness and economic value across diverse populations, such research can accelerate responsible adoption of SDOH-AI applications. The resulting evidence base will also inform longer-term research priorities and help establish SDOH-AI as a sustainable component of healthcare delivery systems.

### 10.4.2 Research Gaps to Address

Despite substantial progress, significant knowledge gaps persist in the SDOH-AI integration field. **Longitudinal SDOH dynamics** represent a critical area requiring further investigation. Current research predominantly treats social factors as static attributes rather than dynamic circumstances that evolve over time (Liu et al., 2024; Melvin et al., 2023). This limitation fundamentally constrains our understanding of how social determinants influence health trajectories and how interventions might modify these relationships. The development of methodologies for modeling SDOH trajectories and their relationship to health outcomes represents a critical innovation opportunity.

Liu et al. (2024) demonstrated that smartphone-derived mobility patterns significantly improved prediction of medication adherence compared to demographic and clinical factors alone, with restricted travel patterns correlating with transportation barriers and neighborhood safety concerns. Further research could explore similar approaches for capturing temporal dynamics of other social determinants using passive sensing, administrative data, or repeated assessments. Methodological innovations needed include temporal modeling frameworks that can handle irregularly sampled SDOH data, account for variable measurement certainty over time, and capture complex interactions between changing social circumstances and health outcomes.

**Cross-domain transfer learning** represents another significant research gap. The field lacks robust methodologies for transferring knowledge between different SDOH domains, healthcare conditions, and patient populations (Cai et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024). Given the data fragmentation challenges inherent to SDOH research, techniques that enable effective transfer learning could substantially accelerate progress. This gap limits the field's ability to leverage insights gained in data-rich contexts to improve care in settings with more limited data availability.

Recent work by Simon et al. (2024) on multimodal foundation models demonstrates promising capabilities in this direction, building on earlier advances in scalable clinical machine learning from Rajkomar et al. (2018) and developments in multimodal clinical data integration by Moukheiber et al. (2024). Further research could explore how knowledge learned in data-rich contexts can be effectively transferred to settings with more limited data availability. Methodological innovations needed include domain adaptation techniques specifically designed for SDOH data, few-shot learning approaches that require minimal labeled examples, and federated knowledge transfer methods that preserve privacy while enabling cross-domain learning.

**Privacy-preserving distributed learning** represents a third critical research gap. Privacy concerns represent a significant barrier to SDOH data integration (Freij et al., 2019; Arons et al., 2019). Emerging approaches like federated learning enable model development across distributed datasets without sharing sensitive individual-level information, potentially addressing this constraint. However, applications to SDOH-specific challenges remain underdeveloped. This gap limits the field's ability to leverage distributed data sources across healthcare and social service sectors, constraining both the quantity and diversity of data available for model development.

Recent work on protecting privacy in digital health interventions (Lyles et al., 2021) and social determinants data interoperability (Golembiewski et al., 2022) provides important groundwork for addressing these challenges. Further research could explore how these approaches can be applied to specific SDOH use cases while maintaining appropriate privacy protections. Methodological innovations needed include federated learning techniques optimized for heterogeneous SDOH data sources, privacy-preserving record linkage methods to connect social and clinical data without exposing identifiers, and differential privacy frameworks specifically calibrated for sensitive social information.

**Patient-centered SDOH representation** constitutes a fourth significant research gap. Current SDOH representations primarily reflect healthcare system priorities rather than patient perspectives on their social circumstances (Thompson et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2022). This gap limits both the ethical foundations and practical utility of SDOH-AI applications, as they may fail to capture the aspects of social context most meaningful to patients themselves. Methodologies that incorporate patient-centered SDOH conceptualization would enhance both the ethical foundations and practical relevance of these models.

Thompson et al. (2024) identified important factors influencing patient disclosure of social risk factors, providing a foundation for this work. These insights complement findings from Gottlieb et al. (2016) on the effectiveness of patient-centered social needs screening and navigation services and work by Hswen et al. (2020) on engaging patients in the design of digital health interventions for social needs. Further research could develop and validate approaches for incorporating patient perspectives throughout the SDOH-AI development lifecycle. Methodological innovations needed include participatory design frameworks for SDOH-AI applications, patient-reported outcome measures specific to social determinants, and mixed-methods approaches that integrate qualitative patient narratives with quantitative modeling.

### 10.4.3 Long-term Research Vision

Looking further ahead, several ambitious research directions hold transformative potential for SDOH-AI integration. **Systems science approaches to SDOH** could advance understanding of complex interactions between social determinants, health behaviors, physiological processes, and healthcare utilization. Such approaches extend beyond prediction to causal modeling of how social systems influence health outcomes through multiple interacting pathways. This direction addresses a fundamental limitation in current approaches, which typically focus on individual-level prediction without adequately modeling the complex social systems in which individuals are embedded.

Emerging methodologies include structural causal models, agent-based simulations, and system dynamics modeling. Pagare et al. (2024) demonstrated how counterfactual frameworks can assess causal relationships between social determinants of mental health and opioid use disorder, identifying housing problems, employment issues, and social isolation as significant causal factors with substantial variation across demographic subgroups. These findings highlight the potential of causal approaches to move beyond prediction to actionable insights about intervention points.

Individual treatment effect estimation extends these approaches to predict person-specific responses to interventions, potentially enabling more precise targeting of SDOH interventions to patients most likely to benefit (Sanchez et al., 2022). Further development of these methodologies could support more sophisticated understanding of how social systems influence health and more targeted intervention approaches. Research priorities include developing causal inference methods specifically designed for the complexities of SDOH data, integrating qualitative systems mapping with quantitative modeling approaches, and creating simulation environments to test potential interventions before implementation.

**Precision public health applications** represent a second long-term research direction. These approaches apply the principles of precision medicine—tailoring interventions based on individual characteristics—to population health challenges. Tanner et al. (2024) used machine learning to evaluate the relationship between social determinants and diabetes prevalence in New York City, employing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to identify the most predictive variables for different neighborhoods and demographic groups. This direction addresses the current gap between individual-level prediction models and population-level interventions, potentially enabling more targeted approaches to addressing social determinants at the community level.

Similar approaches could enable more targeted population health interventions addressing specific combinations of social factors in different communities. Technical considerations include balancing sophisticated methodology with interpretability for public stakeholders, developing appropriate spatial and temporal scales for different application contexts, and creating flexible architectures capable of addressing diverse public health priorities. Research priorities include developing and validating methodologies for community-level risk stratification, creating visualization and communication approaches that effectively translate complex model outputs for public health practitioners, and designing intervention evaluation frameworks that account for both individual and community-level outcomes.

**Learning health systems integration** constitutes a third long-term research direction. These systems continuously learn from data generated during routine care delivery, enabling ongoing improvement of both individual patient care and population health management. Integration of SDOH-AI applications within learning health system frameworks could enable more dynamic adaptation to changing social conditions and emerging evidence. This direction addresses the current gap between model development in research contexts and sustainable implementation in healthcare delivery systems.

Implementation of such systems requires robust data infrastructure, governance processes for model updating and evaluation, and workflow integration to support clinical decision-making. Ong et al. (2024) identified that organizations with strategic leadership commitment, robust governance structures, and agile implementation approaches reported more successful digital transformation initiatives. Further research could explore how these factors specifically influence SDOH-AI integration within learning health systems. Research priorities include developing governance frameworks for continuous model refinement based on implementation experience, creating technical infrastructure that supports seamless integration of new data sources and methodological advances, and designing evaluation approaches that capture both short and long-term impacts on health outcomes and health equity.

The research agenda outlined above encompasses near-term priorities with immediate implementation implications, critical knowledge gaps requiring sustained investigation, and long-term directions with transformative potential. While ambitious, this agenda recognizes that addressing the complex challenges at the intersection of social determinants and health outcomes will require innovative approaches that span disciplines, sectors, and timescales. By addressing these research needs through collaborative, multidisciplinary approaches, the field can advance toward more effective, equitable, and ethical SDOH-AI integration that measurably improves health outcomes for vulnerable populations.
