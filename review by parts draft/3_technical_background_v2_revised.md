# 3. Technical Background

### 3.1 SDOH Conceptual Frameworks and AI/ML Integration Approaches

Social determinants of health (SDOH) encompass the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, representing critical predictive variables that significantly enhance AI/ML model performance across healthcare domains. The evolution of SDOH conceptual frameworks has directly influenced AI/ML integration strategies, with recent research demonstrating that systematic framework adoption fundamentally shapes model architecture, feature engineering approaches, and clinical implementation strategies. Understanding established SDOH frameworks and their computational operationalization provides essential foundation for developing effective AI-enhanced prediction systems that achieve both superior performance and equitable outcomes.

**Healthy People 2030 Framework Implementation in AI/ML Systems**: The Healthy People 2030 framework has emerged as the most practically applicable structure for AI/ML implementations, organizing SDOH into five key domains: Economic Stability, Education Access and Quality, Healthcare Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context. Hammond et al. (2020) demonstrated the practical value of this framework in their analysis of 3,614 Medicare beneficiaries, where models incorporating all five domains achieved near-perfect calibration (observed-to-expected ratios approaching 1.0) for cardiovascular outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities. The study revealed systematic prediction failures in traditional clinical models, with 70% underprediction of cardiovascular hospitalization among Black and Hispanic patients, completely resolved through systematic SDOH integration following the Healthy People 2030 structure.

Empirical validation of SDOH framework effectiveness comes from multiple large-scale studies. Segar et al. (2022) analyzed 123,634 heart failure patients using machine learning models that mapped SDOH variables to the Healthy People 2030 domains, achieving C-statistics of 0.81 for Black patients and 0.82 for non-Black patients in internal validation. Their race-specific models demonstrated superior calibration compared to traditional approaches, with zip code-level SDOH parameters improving net reclassification by 0.22 (95% CI: 0.14-0.30; P < 0.001) specifically for Black patients. The study's systematic variable mapping revealed that economic stability and neighborhood environment domains contributed most strongly to prediction improvements.

Li et al. (2022) provided compelling evidence for SDOH framework integration in their analysis of 210,368 heart failure patients, incorporating 15 SDOH variables organized around Social Deprivation Index and Area Deprivation Index constructs. Their machine learning models revealed significant algorithmic bias in traditional clinical approaches, with systematic underdiagnosis of female, Black, and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients. The integration of systematically organized SDOH variables improved fairness metrics by 45% while maintaining predictive accuracy, demonstrating that framework-guided variable selection addresses both performance and equity concerns.

**WHO Social Determinants Framework and Causal Pathway Modeling**: The WHO Social Determinants Framework provides complementary perspective emphasizing structural determinants versus intermediary determinants, particularly valuable for understanding causal pathways in AI/ML model development. McNeill et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive scoping review of 29 studies using SDOH data for cardiovascular disease prediction, finding that models incorporating WHO framework distinctions between structural and intermediary factors achieved more robust generalization across diverse populations. Their analysis revealed that structural determinants (policy context, socioeconomic position) provided stable predictive features across different healthcare systems, while intermediary determinants (material circumstances, behavioral factors) required more sophisticated temporal modeling approaches.

Chaturvedi et al. (2024) advanced the WHO framework application through their comprehensive analysis of SDOH impact on hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, revealing that social factors drive disparities through complex, multidimensional pathways. Their review demonstrated that structural racism, neighborhood poverty, food security, and transportation access serve as primary mediators in predictive models, with Black individuals facing up to 4Ã— higher CVD mortality explained through systematic SDOH factor integration. This work established that WHO framework-guided variable selection enables more robust causal inference in AI/ML applications.

**Emerging LLM-Powered SDOH Extraction Frameworks**: Recent advances in large language model applications have revolutionized SDOH extraction capabilities, enabling automated identification and classification of social determinants from unstructured clinical documentation.

Their analysis of 3,504 social-related sentences from 2,670 clinical notes demonstrated that transformer-based models significantly outperformed traditional NLP approaches (BERT F1 = 0.87 vs. cTAKES F1 = 0.06) for distinguishing social versus non-social content. The study revealed that occupational factors achieved highest classification accuracy (F1 = 0.774, AUC = 0.965), while more nuanced social contexts required additional model sophistication.

Roy et al. (2025) demonstrated innovative LLM applications for social determinant extraction in cancer care contexts, using GPT-4o to extract linguistic and social determinants from crowdfunding campaign narratives. Their approach achieved sensitivity of 0.786-0.798, with permutation importance analysis revealing that income loss, chemotherapy treatment, family involvement, and empathy factors were primary success predictors. This work established that LLMs can effectively extract complex social determinant features from diverse narrative sources beyond traditional clinical documentation.

**Community-Level SDOH Integration and Geospatial Frameworks**: Advanced SDOH frameworks increasingly incorporate community-level social indicators that require sophisticated geospatial modeling approaches. Tanner et al. (2024) used machine learning to evaluate relationships between SDOH and diabetes prevalence across New York City neighborhoods, revealing that community-level social factors explained significant variance in diabetes rates beyond individual clinical factors.

(2024) examined community-level SDOH impacts on diabetes outcomes in 45,892 patients across 127 communities, finding that area-level deprivation indices, food access metrics, and built environment characteristics explained 23% of variance in diabetes complications. Food desert designation (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18-1.52) and neighborhood walkability scores (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.95) emerged as significant independent predictors, demonstrating the critical role of environmental determinants in predictive modeling frameworks.

Xiao et al. (2025) conducted innovative ML investigation of policy-relevant SDOH and suicide rates using unsupervised learning to identify three distinct county clusters: 'REMOTE' (rural, elderly, marginalized environments), 'COPE' (complex family dynamics, poverty, extreme heat), and 'DIVERSE' (dense, immigrant-rich, economically unequal areas). Each cluster demonstrated different suicide rate patterns across demographic groups, providing foundation for geographically-informed SDOH framework development.

**Specialized Population SDOH Frameworks**: Recent research has extended SDOH frameworks to specialized populations requiring tailored approaches. Hobensack et al. (2025) examined social risk factor impacts on ML model performance across racial and ethnic groups in home healthcare, finding that social factors had differential impacts across demographic groups.

(2024) developed comprehensive AI-ready multimodal data pipelines that seamlessly link individual clinical data with community-level social indicators, creating unprecedented opportunities for comprehensive predictive modeling. Their framework addresses temporal alignment, geographic scaling, and privacy preservation, enabling successful deployment across multiple health systems while maintaining data integrity and regulatory compliance.

**Standardization and Interoperability Challenges**: The proliferation of SDOH frameworks has created challenges for interoperability and standardization across health systems. Guevara et al. (2024) identified significant barriers in SDOH terminology standardization, finding that SDOH information exists in structured fields only 23% of the time across 15 health systems. Their analysis revealed the need for standardized SDOH data models that enable consistent framework implementation across diverse clinical environments while maintaining local customization capabilities.

### 3.2 Machine Learning Architectures and Performance Optimization for SDOH Integration
