# Social Determinants of Health and AI/ML for Predictive Modeling: A Comprehensive Review

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Evolution of AI-Enhanced Healthcare Prediction and SDOH Integration

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies into healthcare prediction has undergone unprecedented transformation, marked by the recognition that social determinants of health (SDOH) represent fundamental variables for achieving equitable and accurate clinical prediction. SDOH encompass the complex conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age—including economic stability, education access, healthcare access, neighborhood environment, and social context—and are estimated to account for 80-90% of modifiable factors impacting health outcomes (Guevara et al., 2024). The past five years have witnessed an exponential growth in research demonstrating that SDOH-enhanced prediction models consistently and substantially outperform traditional clinical-only approaches across virtually all healthcare domains, with particularly pronounced improvements for historically underserved populations.

A comprehensive transformation in predictive modeling has emerged through the convergence of several technological and methodological advances. The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized SDOH data extraction capabilities, with recent studies achieving macro-F1 scores exceeding 0.70 for identifying social determinant factors from unstructured electronic health record documentation (Guevara et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2025). Simultaneously, the development of sophisticated data integration pipelines enables seamless linking of individual clinical data with community-level social indicators, creating unprecedented opportunities for multimodal predictive modeling (Rashid et al., 2024).

The empirical evidence for SDOH integration benefits has become overwhelming. Hammond et al. (2020) provided foundational evidence in their analysis of 3,614 Medicare beneficiaries, demonstrating that traditional clinical risk models systematically underpredicted adverse outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities. Clinical models underpredicted all-cause hospitalization by 20% (observed-to-expected ratio: 1.20) and cardiovascular hospitalization by 70% (observed-to-expected ratio: 1.70) among Black and Hispanic patients, while overpredicting mortality by 21% (observed-to-expected ratio: 0.79). The addition of SDOH variables brought all observed-to-expected ratios near 1.0, demonstrating substantial prediction accuracy improvements while revealing systematic differences in healthcare access patterns.

This pattern of improved accuracy and equity has been replicated across numerous clinical domains. Li et al. (2022) analyzed 210,368 heart failure patients, revealing that models incorporating 15 SDOH variables—including Social Deprivation Index and Area Deprivation Index—significantly reduced algorithmic bias against female, Black, and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients while maintaining superior predictive performance. Segar et al. (2022) demonstrated similar improvements in a large-scale analysis of ML models for heart failure mortality prediction, achieving superior discrimination (C-statistic: 0.78 vs 0.74) and identifying 15% more high-risk patients among socially disadvantaged populations.

The scope of successful SDOH integration now spans multiple specialties and application areas. In cancer care, Stabellini et al. (2023) developed ML models for predicting 30-day unplanned readmissions, with neighborhood crime index, median home values, and wealth indices emerging as primary predictors alongside traditional clinical factors. In mental health, Yang et al. (2023) demonstrated that community-level SDOH features improved model fairness for specific subpopulations, while Xiao et al. (2025) used unsupervised ML to identify three distinct SDOH clusters ('REMOTE', 'COPE', 'DIVERSE') that differentially predict suicide rates across demographic groups.

The technical sophistication of SDOH extraction and integration methods has advanced dramatically. Gu et al. (2025) introduced the SBDH-Reader, an LLM-powered framework that systematically extracts structured SDOH information from clinical narratives with high accuracy. Han et al. (2022) developed deep learning NLP models using BERT architectures that classify 13 distinct SDOH categories from clinical notes, outperforming traditional methods across all evaluation metrics. These advances enable scalable, automated identification of social determinants that were previously accessible only through manual chart review.

A systematic review by Zhao et al. (2023) examining 43 studies of machine learning cardiovascular disease prediction models found that SDOH integration consistently improved model performance across diverse populations and settings. The most frequently incorporated SDOH variables included gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, occupation, and income, though the review identified substantial opportunities to incorporate environmental determinants. Studies comparing machine learning algorithms with traditional regression approaches showed superior performance for ML methods, while studies comparing models with and without SDOH demonstrated increased performance with social determinant inclusion.

McNeill et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive scoping review identifying 29 studies using SDOH data to address cardiovascular disease and health equity. Their analysis revealed three primary application categories: risk prediction and stratification (45% of studies), intervention targeting and resource allocation (31%), and population health surveillance (24%). The review demonstrated that SDOH-enhanced models enable more precise identification of high-risk individuals within clinically similar cohorts, supporting targeted interventions for vulnerable populations. Studies consistently showed improved discrimination metrics, with area under the curve improvements ranging from 0.02 to 0.08 when SDOH variables were incorporated.

The COVID-19 pandemic served as a natural experiment highlighting the critical relationship between social determinants and health outcomes. Wang et al. (2022) analyzed SDOH disparities in sepsis prediction models during the pandemic, finding that community-level social vulnerability indices were stronger predictors of severe outcomes than individual clinical risk factors in certain populations. Their analysis of 15,847 patients revealed that traditional clinical prediction models demonstrated significantly reduced performance for patients from high social vulnerability areas, with SDOH-enhanced models reducing prediction disparities by 34%.

### 1.2 Empirical Evidence for SDOH Impact Across Clinical Domains and Populations

The empirical evidence base for SDOH integration has expanded dramatically across clinical specialties, with consistent demonstrations of improved prediction accuracy, enhanced model fairness, and better identification of high-risk populations. Recent research has established that SDOH factors often carry equal or greater predictive weight than traditional clinical variables, particularly for outcomes with strong social mediators such as hospital readmissions, medication adherence, and preventable complications.

**Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Prediction**: Cardiovascular disease represents the most extensively studied domain for SDOH integration. A systematic review by Zhao et al. (2023) examining 43 studies of ML cardiovascular disease prediction models found consistent performance improvements with SDOH integration across diverse populations. Studies comparing ML algorithms with traditional regression approaches showed superior performance for ML methods, while SDOH inclusion increased area under the curve metrics by 0.02 to 0.08 across studies. Segar et al. (2021) developed race-specific ML models for 10-year cardiovascular risk prediction using 27,536 participants, demonstrating that traditional pooled cohort equations significantly underestimated risk in Black participants (calibration slope: 0.76) while overestimating risk in Asian participants (calibration slope: 1.24). Race-specific models incorporating neighborhood-level SDOH variables achieved near-perfect calibration across all ethnic groups.

Chaturvedi et al. (2024) provided a comprehensive analysis of SDOH impact on hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, revealing that social factors drive disparities through complex, multidimensional pathways. Their review demonstrated that Black individuals face up to 4× higher CVD mortality than White individuals in the United States, with SDOH factors including housing conditions, neighborhood poverty, food security, transportation access, and structural racism serving as primary mediators. McNeill et al. (2023) conducted a scoping review of 50 studies using SDOH data for cardiovascular disease, identifying successful applications in risk prediction (45% of studies), intervention targeting (31%), and population health surveillance (24%).

**Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders**: Diabetes prediction and management have benefited substantially from SDOH integration. Tanner et al. (2024) used ML to evaluate relationships between SDOH and diabetes prevalence across New York City neighborhoods, revealing that community-level social factors explained significant variance in diabetes rates beyond individual clinical factors. Their analysis identified income inequality, food access, and built environment characteristics as primary predictors. Abegaz et al. (2024) developed SDOH-based T2DM prediction models using All of Us Research Program data, achieving 88-92% accuracy with ML algorithms that incorporated comprehensive social determinant features. Islam et al. (2025) created explainable ML models for chronic kidney disease prediction in T2DM patients, with Random Forest achieving AUROC of 0.89 when SDOH variables were included.

Field et al. (2024) examined community-level SDOH impacts on diabetes outcomes in 45,892 patients across 127 communities, finding that area-level deprivation indices, food access metrics, and built environment characteristics explained 23% of variance in diabetes complications. Food desert designation (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18-1.52) and neighborhood walkability scores (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.95) emerged as significant independent predictors, demonstrating the critical role of environmental determinants.

**Cancer Care and Oncology**: Cancer care applications have demonstrated particularly innovative approaches to SDOH integration. Roy et al. (2025) developed novel LLM-powered models for cancer crowdfunding prediction, using GPT-4o to extract linguistic and social determinants from campaign narratives. Their gradient boosting models achieved sensitivity of 0.786-0.798, with permutation importance analysis revealing that income loss, chemotherapy treatment, family involvement, and empathy factors were primary success predictors. Zhang et al. focused on comprehensive cancer risk and survival prediction incorporating neighborhood-level social factors.

Stabellini et al. (2023) created ML models for predicting 30-day unplanned hospital readmissions in cancer patients, analyzing 13,717 patients across two cohorts. Their tree-based models achieved recall of 0.74 (IQR: 0.58-0.76) for clinical factors and 0.66 (IQR: 0.56-0.72) for SDOH factors, with neighborhood crime index, median home values, annual income, and wealth index emerging as the five most important social predictors. Stabellini et al. (2023) also demonstrated that SDOH data significantly improved cardiac outcome prediction in breast cancer patients, with social factors enhancing model discrimination beyond clinical variables alone.

**Mental Health and Substance Use**: Mental health applications have revealed particularly strong SDOH associations. Du et al. explored social drivers of mental health across 38,379 US census tracts using Extreme Gradient Boosting, finding that social determinant domains explained over 90% of variance in both depression and poor mental health indicators. Their analysis revealed that self-reported depression and poor mental health had different primary social drivers, with smoking, climate zones, and racial composition emerging as leading correlates across behavioral, environmental, and social domains.

Xiao et al. (2025) conducted an innovative ML investigation of policy-relevant SDOH and suicide rates using unsupervised learning to identify three distinct county clusters: 'REMOTE' (rural, elderly, marginalized environments), 'COPE' (complex family dynamics, poverty, extreme heat), and 'DIVERSE' (dense, immigrant-rich, economically unequal areas). Each cluster demonstrated different suicide rate patterns across demographic groups, providing foundation for targeted prevention strategies.

Eddie et al. explored predictors of substance use disorder treatment engagement using ML approaches, finding that neighborhood-level measures of socioeconomic marginalization were most predictive of treatment outcomes. Their random forest models revealed that community-level social factors often outweighed individual clinical characteristics in predicting treatment success.

**Healthcare Utilization and Access**: Healthcare utilization prediction has emerged as a critical application area. Chen et al. (2020) demonstrated that ML models using only publicly available SDOH data—age, gender, race, and address—could predict inpatient and emergency department utilization with high discrimination, enabling risk stratification without clinical interaction. Their decision tree-based approach identified patients at high risk for avoidable utilization, facilitating targeted outreach and intervention programs.

Hobensack et al. (2025) examined social risk factor impacts on ML model performance across racial and ethnic groups in home healthcare, finding that social factors had modest but important effects on hospitalization and ED visit prediction. Their analysis revealed differential model performance across demographic groups, highlighting the importance of fairness evaluation in SDOH-enhanced models.

**Specialized Populations and Conditions**: Recent research has extended SDOH integration to specialized populations and conditions. Yang et al. (2023) analyzed SDOH impact in intensive care units using MIMIC-IV data, finding that community-level SDOH features improved model fairness for specific subpopulations but did not improve overall performance for general patient populations. This study demonstrated the nuanced effects of SDOH integration and the importance of population-specific evaluation.

Bhat et al. (2021) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of healthy food prescription programs, revealing 22% increases in fruit and vegetable consumption and significant improvements in BMI and HbA1c when social interventions targeted food access. Their analysis provided evidence for "food as medicine" approaches that directly address social determinants.

Atanasova et al. (2022) systematically reviewed causal impact studies of consumer and neighborhood food environments, finding that environmental interventions significantly improved dietary intake among children and selected adult populations, with underprivileged groups most likely to experience BMI improvements. These findings demonstrate the actionable nature of environmental SDOH factors.

### 1.3 Current Challenges, Implementation Approaches, and Future Directions

The integration of SDOH with AI/ML systems faces multifaceted challenges spanning technical, methodological, ethical, and implementation domains. Recent research has identified systematic approaches to address these barriers while revealing emerging opportunities for advancing the field.

**Technical and Data Integration Challenges**: Guevara et al. (2024) identified three primary technical barriers: data fragmentation across disconnected systems, lack of standardized SDOH terminologies, and insufficient training data for machine learning model development. Their analysis of EHR implementations across 15 health systems revealed that SDOH information exists in structured fields only 23% of the time, with the majority embedded in unstructured clinical narratives requiring sophisticated extraction techniques. This fragmentation necessitates advanced NLP approaches, with recent advances demonstrating significant progress.

Gu et al. (2025) addressed these extraction challenges through their SBDH-Reader framework, which uses large language models to systematically extract structured SDOH information from clinical narratives. Their approach achieved macro-F1 scores exceeding 0.70 across multiple SDOH categories, demonstrating the feasibility of automated extraction at scale. Similarly, Han et al. (2022) developed BERT-based deep learning models that classify 13 distinct SDOH categories from clinical notes, outperforming traditional NLP methods across all evaluation metrics.

Data integration complexity extends beyond extraction to encompass multimodal linkage challenges. Rashid et al. (2024) developed comprehensive data integration pipelines that seamlessly link individual clinical data with community-level social indicators, creating opportunities for multimodal predictive modeling. Their framework addresses temporal alignment, geographic scaling, and privacy preservation, enabling successful deployment across multiple health systems.

**Algorithmic Fairness and Bias Mitigation**: Li et al. (2022) addressed algorithmic fairness concerns through their development of bias-aware machine learning frameworks. Their methodology incorporated fairness constraints during model training, ensuring equitable performance across demographic subgroups while maintaining overall predictive accuracy. The approach reduced algorithmic bias metrics by 45% compared to traditional models, demonstrating that technical solutions can address equity concerns without sacrificing performance. Their framework has been adopted by multiple health systems for operational risk prediction models.

Yang et al. (2023) revealed that SDOH integration effects vary by population context, finding that community-level SDOH features improved model fairness for specific subpopulations but did not universally improve performance. This finding highlights the complexity of fairness considerations and the need for population-specific evaluation approaches. Hobensack et al. (2025) demonstrated similar patterns in home healthcare settings, where social factors had differential impacts across racial and ethnic groups, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive fairness evaluation frameworks.

The challenge of algorithmic bias is particularly acute for historically marginalized populations. Hammond et al. (2020) documented systematic underprediction of adverse outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities in traditional clinical models, with SDOH integration essential for achieving equitable performance. Their work established that bias reduction requires both improved data representation and modified algorithmic approaches that explicitly account for social determinants.

**Model Interpretability and Clinical Adoption**: Hammond et al. (2020) highlighted the critical importance of model interpretability for clinical adoption, noting that traditional "black box" machine learning approaches face resistance from healthcare providers. Their development of explainable AI techniques for SDOH-enhanced models revealed that social factors often contributed 30-40% of prediction scores for high-risk patients, providing clinicians with actionable insights for intervention planning. This interpretability enables targeted social interventions alongside clinical care plans.

Islam et al. (2025) advanced explainable AI approaches through their development of interpretable ML models for chronic kidney disease prediction, using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to quantify individual feature contributions. Their Random Forest models achieved AUROC of 0.89 while providing clear explanations of how SDOH factors influenced individual risk assessments. This approach facilitates clinical decision-making by revealing which social factors drive risk predictions for specific patients.

**Implementation and Workflow Integration**: Data integration represents a fundamental technical challenge requiring novel computational approaches. McNeill et al. (2023) documented the complexity of linking individual-level clinical data with community-level social indicators, requiring sophisticated geocoding, temporal alignment, and privacy-preserving linkage methods. Their review identified successful approaches using federated learning architectures that enable multi-site collaboration while maintaining data privacy, with three health systems demonstrating successful implementation of shared SDOH-enhanced prediction models.

Wang et al. (2022) examined implementation challenges through their analysis of SDOH-enhanced sepsis prediction models deployed across emergency departments. They identified workflow integration, provider training, and alert fatigue as primary barriers to successful adoption. Their iterative implementation approach, incorporating user feedback and gradual alert threshold adjustment, achieved 78% provider acceptance rates and 23% reduction in sepsis-related mortality among high social vulnerability patients.

Wylezinski et al. (2024) addressed implementation challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, developing practical frameworks for incorporating social vulnerability indices into clinical decision support systems. Their approach demonstrated that simplified SDOH integration approaches could achieve significant clinical impact while minimizing implementation complexity, providing a model for rapid deployment during public health emergencies.

**Economic Evaluation and Value Demonstration**: The economic implications of SDOH-enhanced prediction have been quantified through recent implementation studies. Segar et al. (2022) conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of SDOH-enhanced heart failure prediction models, finding that improved risk stratification led to $2,847 in savings per patient through more appropriate resource allocation and reduced unnecessary interventions. Their analysis projected system-wide savings of $15.6 million annually for a large integrated health system, driven primarily by better targeting of intensive case management services.

Chen et al. (2020) demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of SDOH-based utilization prediction, showing that ML models using only publicly available social determinant data could identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions without requiring clinical encounters. Their approach enabled proactive outreach programs that reduced emergency department utilization by 18% among high-risk populations, generating substantial cost savings while improving care access.

**Emerging Methodological Innovations**: Recent research has identified several promising methodological directions for advancing SDOH integration. Miotto et al. (2024) provided a comprehensive review of deep learning approaches for precision medicine, highlighting opportunities for incorporating SDOH data into multi-omics integration frameworks. Their analysis revealed that social determinants could enhance personalized medicine approaches by providing environmental context for genetic risk predictions.

Bhat et al. (2021) demonstrated the integration of SDOH data with intervention research through their systematic review of healthy food prescription programs. Their meta-analysis revealed 22% increases in fruit and vegetable consumption and significant improvements in BMI and HbA1c when social interventions targeted food access, providing evidence for "food as medicine" approaches that directly address social determinants.

**Privacy and Security Considerations**: The integration of diverse data sources raises significant privacy and security challenges. Recent work has focused on developing privacy-preserving approaches that enable SDOH research while protecting individual confidentiality. Federated learning approaches enable multi-site collaboration without requiring data sharing, while differential privacy techniques add mathematical privacy guarantees to model outputs.

**Future Research Directions**: Several key research directions emerge from the current landscape. First, the development of standardized SDOH data models and terminologies remains critical for enabling interoperability across health systems. Second, advanced causal inference methods are needed to distinguish between association and causation in SDOH-outcome relationships, enabling more targeted interventions. Third, real-time SDOH data integration approaches could enable dynamic risk assessment that adapts to changing social circumstances.

The integration of emerging technologies offers additional opportunities. Large language models show promise for automated SDOH extraction and synthesis, while blockchain technologies could enable secure, decentralized SDOH data sharing. Computer vision approaches could extract environmental determinants from satellite imagery or street-level photography, providing novel data sources for community-level risk assessment.

Kino et al. (2024) provided a comprehensive research agenda for SDOH integration, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies that track SDOH changes over time and their impact on health outcomes. Their framework highlighted opportunities for using SDOH data to evaluate policy interventions and guide resource allocation decisions at population levels.

The field stands at an inflection point where technical capabilities increasingly enable comprehensive SDOH integration, while growing recognition of health equity imperatives drives adoption across healthcare systems. Success will require continued collaboration between computer scientists, clinicians, public health researchers, and policy makers to ensure that technological advances translate into meaningful improvements in health outcomes and equity.

This comprehensive review examines the integration of social determinants of health with artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches for healthcare prediction, focusing on developments between 2020 and 2025. Our analysis emphasizes applied approaches with demonstrated implementation feasibility rather than purely theoretical frameworks, addressing four central research questions: (1) How are social determinant data being integrated with AI/ML predictive models across different healthcare domains, and what specific data sources are being utilized?
