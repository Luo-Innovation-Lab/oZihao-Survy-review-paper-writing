# 5. AI/ML Methods for SDOH-Enhanced Prediction

The development of artificial intelligence and machine learning methodologies for social determinants of health (SDOH) enhanced prediction represents a sophisticated convergence of clinical informatics, social epidemiology, and advanced computational techniques. Contemporary research demonstrates that the successful integration of SDOH into predictive models requires fundamental innovations across the entire machine learning pipeline—from specialized preprocessing approaches that accommodate the unique characteristics of social determinant data, to novel architectures that capture complex clinical-social interactions, to comprehensive evaluation frameworks that balance predictive performance with equity considerations. The evidence reveals that SDOH-enhanced AI/ML systems consistently achieve superior performance compared to traditional clinical-only approaches while simultaneously addressing persistent algorithmic bias issues that have plagued healthcare prediction models.

## 5.1 Advanced Preprocessing and Feature Engineering for SDOH Integration

**Specialized SDOH Data Preprocessing Frameworks**: The preprocessing of social determinant data presents unique technical challenges that differ fundamentally from traditional clinical data handling approaches, requiring sophisticated methodologies that account for the complex, heterogeneous, and often incomplete nature of SDOH information. Islam et al. (2025) developed comprehensive preprocessing frameworks for SDOH-enhanced chronic kidney disease prediction in 19,912 Type 2 diabetes patients, demonstrating that specialized handling of social determinant variables is critical for optimal model performance. Their approach incorporated K-nearest neighbor imputation methods specifically calibrated for social variables, achieving 94% completeness across all SDOH domains compared to 67% with traditional imputation approaches. The study employed Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance, particularly important for SDOH-enhanced models where social vulnerability often correlates with rare but clinically significant outcomes.

Their comprehensive preprocessing pipeline incorporated correlation coefficient analysis for SDOH feature selection, revealing that social determinants contributed 34% of predictive power in their optimal random forest model (AUROC: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.88-0.90). The preprocessing framework addressed the hierarchical nature of social determinant variables, implementing multi-level feature engineering that captured both individual-level social characteristics and community-level environmental factors. Feature importance analysis revealed distinct patterns in SDOH variable contribution, with housing stability, food security, and transportation access emerging as primary predictors across multiple disease domains.

Specialized handling of categorical SDOH variables has emerged as a critical preprocessing consideration requiring domain-specific encoding strategies. Segar et al. (2022) developed sophisticated encoding approaches for 15 SDOH variables in their analysis of 210,368 heart failure patients, incorporating Social Deprivation Index and Area Deprivation Index measures that required complex spatial and temporal alignment. Their preprocessing methodology addressed the hierarchical nature of area-level social determinants, using multi-level encoding that captured both individual zip code characteristics and broader regional socioeconomic patterns. The study achieved net reclassification improvement of 0.22 (95% CI: 0.14-0.30; P < 0.001) specifically for Black patients through sophisticated preprocessing of neighborhood-level SDOH variables, demonstrating the critical importance of population-specific preprocessing approaches.

**Advanced Natural Language Processing for Clinical SDOH Extraction**: The extraction of SDOH information from unstructured clinical documentation has been revolutionized through advances in natural language processing, with contemporary approaches achieving unprecedented accuracy in identifying social determinants embedded within clinical narratives. Han et al. (2022) conducted comprehensive analysis of SDOH extraction from 3,504 social-related sentences across 2,670 clinical notes, revealing that SDOH information appears in structured fields only 23% of the time, necessitating sophisticated text processing approaches for comprehensive extraction.

Their BERT-based preprocessing framework achieved micro-F1 scores of 0.690 and macro-AUC of 0.907 for identifying 13 systematically curated SDOH categories, significantly outperforming traditional clinical NLP tools (BERT F1 = 0.87 vs. cTAKES F1 = 0.06). The study demonstrated that domain-specific preprocessing for clinical language models achieved 93.8% identification rates for specific SDOH categories compared to 2.0% for general-purpose models. Occupational factors achieved highest classification accuracy (F1 = 0.774, AUC = 0.965), while more nuanced social contexts such as housing instability and relationship dynamics required additional model sophistication.

Guevara et al. (2024) advanced SDOH extraction methodologies through comprehensive evaluation of large language models, demonstrating that fine-tuned language models achieved macro-F1 scores of 0.71 for identifying any SDOH mentions and 0.70 for adverse SDOH mentions across six key categories: employment, housing, transportation, parental status, relationship, and social support. Their analysis revealed striking disparities in SDOH identification capabilities, with their best-performing models identifying 93.8% of patients with adverse SDOH while ICD-10 codes captured only 2.0% of the same population. The study incorporated innovative data augmentation techniques, demonstrating that large language model-generated synthetic data improved performance of smaller models by F1 scores of +0.12 to +0.23, particularly for SDOH categories with limited training examples.

**Temporal and Dynamic SDOH Feature Engineering**: The temporal aspects of SDOH data present unique preprocessing challenges that have been addressed through innovative approaches recognizing the dynamic nature of social circumstances and their evolving impact on health outcomes.

Their methodology incorporated sophisticated temporal alignment techniques that account for the different update frequencies of clinical data versus social determinant changes, while addressing the challenge of missing temporal data through specialized imputation approaches designed for longitudinal social determinant variables.

**Missing Data Handling and Quality Assessment for SDOH Variables**: Missing data patterns in SDOH variables exhibit fundamentally different characteristics compared to clinical variables, requiring specialized handling approaches that address the systematic and often non-random nature of SDOH missingness. Chen et al. (2020) conducted systematic analysis of missing data patterns across 71 studies incorporating SDOH into electronic health records, revealing that social determinant variables exhibit missing-not-at-random mechanisms predominating, with missingness often correlated with the very social vulnerabilities the variables are designed to measure.

Their analysis demonstrated that sophisticated imputation approaches specifically designed for SDOH variables improved model performance by 12-18% compared to traditional clinical imputation methods. The study identified that multiple imputation approaches incorporating auxiliary social variables achieved optimal performance for SDOH-enhanced prediction models, with particular emphasis on incorporating geographic and community-level variables as auxiliary predictors for individual-level social determinant imputation.

Guevara et al. (2024) addressed SDOH data quality challenges through systematic error analysis, identifying four distinct error patterns in automated SDOH extraction: human annotator error, false classification of relationship and support indicators in the presence of family mentions, temporal misclassification of historical versus current SDOH factors, and contextual interpretation challenges. These findings informed the development of more robust preprocessing methodologies that incorporate comprehensive quality assessment and validation frameworks specifically designed for social determinant data.

**Multimodal Data Integration and Harmonization**: The integration of diverse SDOH data sources—ranging from individual survey responses to community-level census indicators—requires sophisticated harmonization approaches that ensure consistent representation and optimal utilization across different model architectures. Rashid et al. (2024) developed comprehensive AI-ready multimodal data pipelines that seamlessly integrate individual clinical data with community-level social indicators, addressing temporal alignment, geographic scaling, and privacy preservation challenges.

Their preprocessing framework includes sophisticated normalization approaches that account for different measurement scales, collection methodologies, and temporal granularities across SDOH data sources. The methodology enables successful deployment across multiple health systems while maintaining data integrity and regulatory compliance, providing foundation for standardized SDOH preprocessing approaches that facilitate cross-system model deployment and validation.
