**Citation**: Kelli HM, Kim JH, Tahhan AS, Liu C, Ko Y-A, Hammadah M, Sullivan S, Sandesara P, Alkhoder AA, Choudhary FK, Gafeer MM, Patel K, Qadir S, Lewis TT, Vaccarino V, Sperling LS, Quyyumi AA. Living in Food Deserts and Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease. J Am Heart Assoc. 2019;8:e010694.

**Publication Date**: 2019

**Type of Publication**: Type 3 (Original Research)

**Focus and Relevance**:
- Evaluates the impact of living in food deserts on incident cardiovascular events
- Analyzes which component of food deserts (poor access to food or low income) drives adverse outcomes
- Uses geocoded residential addresses linked to USDA defined food desert classifications

**Key Content**:
- Large cohort study (N=4,944) following patients with suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease
- Found living in food deserts was associated with 44% higher risk of myocardial infarction after adjusting for traditional risk factors
- Demonstrated that low area income, not poor food access, was the primary driver of increased cardiovascular risk
- Used sophisticated statistical methods including Fine and Gray's subdistribution hazard models

**AI/ML Content**:
- Does not implement advanced AI/ML methods
- Uses traditional statistical modeling for risk prediction
- Relies on geocoding and USDA classification systems for food environment assessment

**Relevance for Review**:
This paper directly addresses SDOH (food environment) impact on cardiovascular outcomes and identifies the specific socioeconomic component (area income) that drives risk, rather than physical food access. While it doesn't apply AI/ML approaches, it provides critical evidence that could inform feature selection and prioritization in future predictive models incorporating SDOH data.
